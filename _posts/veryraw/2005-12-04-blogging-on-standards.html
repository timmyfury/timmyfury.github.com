    content: I'm missing it, and that makes me a sad panda. I'll see you tonight at happy hour, yes? At least I can satisfy some of my nerdiness there.

    content: I'll be there.  We got a bunch of free stuff when we got here, including free drink tickets at the Happy Hour.  Couldn't possibly give up the chance to drink with nerds for free. Hope to see you there!

    content: Welcome to the cult of web dork celebrities. Shit, for 500 bucks I could have had round trip tickets to Hawaii or a few bottles of Courvoisier XO instead of being raped of 8 hours and $500 by the the 3 standards musketeers; they may be good but the conference was a let down.

<p>Tomorrow I will be going to <a href="http://aneventapart.com/">An Event Apart</a>, a one day conference about Web Standards.  Two great names in standards will be there.  <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/">Eric Meyer</a> and <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/">Jeffrey Zeldman</a> are standards celebrities that I have been reading since I got into standards almost three years ago.  I am probably more excited for this event than I should be (I already have my clothes layed out), but this is not only my first web conference, but its at my favorite place on earth, The Franklin Institute, to boot.</p>
<p>I will be blogging from the event elsewhere.  I'm joining <a href="http://www.jefflouella.com/">Jeff</a> and <a href="http://www.jamesmuspratt.com/">James</a> and a few others on the <a href="http://www.phillystandards.org/blog/">Philadelphia Standards Organization blog</a> alongside the fellows of <a href="http://noteworthy.pixelworthy.com/">Pixelworthy</a> in documenting the events and the learning and the fun.  If you are in to this sort of thing or just love my awesome writing, <a href="http://www.phillystandards.org/blog/">stop over and visit the blog</a> to see what's going on.</p>
