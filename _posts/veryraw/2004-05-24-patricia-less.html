<p>I dropped Trish off at the airport at 5:30 this morning. She's on her way to <a href="http://www.ambergriscaye.com/pages/town/facts.html">Belize</a> for two weeks. She is <a href="http://learn.dccc.edu/~saquilan/belize03.html">taking a class</a> down there. I sure am proud of her for venturing off into the jungle for two weeks by herself but I sure will miss her. No phones. No communication with home. </p>
<p><em>...Sniffle...</em></p>
<p>She'll be <a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap001127.html">somewhere</a> out there tonight. I'll be thinking about her.</p>
