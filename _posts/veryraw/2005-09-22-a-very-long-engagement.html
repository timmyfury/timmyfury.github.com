    content: "Why do we hate real endings in movies?  Maybe if movies start to give true life endings, we won't feel so disappointed in our own lives when thing go so horrible.  Life is always full of shitty endings.  It is about time some movies portray this. "

      Another thing I forgot to mention
      
      When I saw this title, before I began reading. I thought you proposed to Trish and were explaining to everyone that it will be a very long engagement.

<p>From the director of <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0211915/">Amelie</a>, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, starring the star of <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0211915/">Amelie</a>, Audrey Tautou, comes <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0344510/">A Very Long Engagment</a>.  It's a story about a girl's search for her fiance after he is reported dead from a battle in World War one.</p>
<p>It's a little gruesome in the beginning.  It quickly converts to a wonderful hunt for Mathilde's fiance. What I love most about the movie is it walks you through every step of the search for Manech without dragging.  It's compelling and interesting.  And the best part of all is that up until the very end you don't know whether they are actually going to find him or not.  I won't tell because I want you to see it, but Trish was a little disappointed because it didn't give her the nice clean ending that she loves.</p>
<p>Okay, I don't care if you see it or not.  I love that Mathilde finds Manech but he isn't in the same shape he was at the beginning.  He's not deformed, he just doesn't remember her.  I love that the story ends in such a true and pure way.  The entire time she is looking for him, even though he has been reported as dead, out of her love for him.  The whole search is about love and hope.  In the end the feeling of the movie isn't cheapened by a happy go lucky, everything is perfect,  remember you ending.  She finds him but he has no idea who she is.  Is she disappointed? No.  She's happy that she found the one she loves.  The theme of the movie is preserved and everyone gets what they want.  Except for Trish, who loves closure in her movies.</p>
<p>I also loved the subtitles.  It was in French, like Amelie, and as <a href="http://veryraw.com/history/2005/03/kerenann-nolita/">I've mentioned before</a>, I love the French Language.  Gives it a magical feeling that I haven't felt since I watched <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0299977/">Hero</a>.</p>
