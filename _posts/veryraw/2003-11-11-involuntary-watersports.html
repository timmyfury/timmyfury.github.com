<p>New pet peeve: Thinking that I've shaken enough then zipping up and walking   away from the urinal only to feel the rush of cold urine run down my legs. I'm   not talking about a little fucking drip here either. I'm talking about a veritable   waterfall - nay a urinefall down my leg. Its horrible when i happens at work cause you aren't sure if its going to come through your pants while your walking   down the hall so you end up looking like a damned fool as you stare at your   own crotch walking back to your desk. It happened to me tonight though. I am wearing sweatpants. Now might I note that I have hated sweatpants for all of   my life but as I have aged slightly now I have found myself cold rather frequently.   In steps sweatpants. Regardless the weird thing about sweatpants is that they   are fuzzy on the inside and they apparently lack the ability to soak up urine. FUCKING URINE!</p>
<p>Next on the adgenda, visual basic. It can die. Useless, useless useless. Easy?   Yes. Useless? Yes. Make me want to kill when I write programs in it that will   never do anything useful or get used by anyone but my professor? you bet your   bottom dollar. I can't wait until I don't have to take anymore fucking useless   programming courses. What a waste. There should be one programming course. DPR237   - How to lie in a job interview that you know language X, then learn it in a   week when you get the job. Perhaps also <a href="http://members.cox.net/impunity/endofworld.swf">DPR245   - World domination with PHP/MySQL</a>.</p>
<p>Last things last, <a href="http://www.aboyandhiscomputer.com/churchsigngenerator/index.php">this link</a> (the guy has web-based pet peeves on the site. Well, heres mine. If you run a blog and are graced with enough visits to sell merchandise about yourself, fucking pay for enough bandwidth to support your page.) - this link was was sent to me last night and it brought back a conversation that Mark had a while   ago where I wanted to buy a bunch of those letters you see on the signs of churches.   Then I would sneak up onto the lawns at night and change the sign around. My favorite is, "Jesus causes your nightmares."</p>
