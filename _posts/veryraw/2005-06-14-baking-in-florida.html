I spent last week in Florida.  Some of you may not have noticed since, as a dedicated nerd, I prewrote a few entries to post while I was down there.  I checked my email twice.  Amazing.  That's my average per second check usually.  I barely thought about anything.  It was wonderful.  Trish and I both came back relaxed as all get out and had two days of blissful recovery before we returned to work.  <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/timmyfury/sets/451123/">I've posted all of my images on flickr</a>.
