<p>A few days ago <a href="http://veryraw.com/history/2005/04/why-do-we-pay-for-this/">I sang the praise of the MTA and their spectatular subway system</a>.  Then I read a post on slashdot that says <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/04/12/0313204&tid=126">MTA is adding another line which will be computerized</a>.  So let me get this straight, they are taking actions that could help keep costs down by adding lines that won't require as much staff to control <strong>and</strong> they are planning on computerizing more?  Amazing.  Wonder why Septa isn't doing that.</p>
<p><a href="http://veryraw.com/history/2005/04/why-do-we-pay-for-this/#comment-641">Geoff brought up a great point</a> in saying that the employees are partially to blame for their lack of willingness to share the costs of healthcare.  But even better was his mentioning the misappropriation of funds.</p>
<p>I was at the Wawa the other day after work and one of the guys up there told us that the Market Frankford El reconstruction project is going to take longer because they fired one of the contractors after they poured pillars that didn't withstand stress tests.  The other issue with the pillars they poured is that some of them are not just off by a few inches, they are off by feet.  This means that they will have to tear them down and repour them.  It's already taken too long, how much longer will this add?  an extra year. <a href="http://www.philly.com/mld/dailynews/news/local/11171252.htm">Amazing!</a>  Scroll down to get the part about the El.</p>
