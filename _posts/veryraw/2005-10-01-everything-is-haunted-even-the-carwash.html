<p>Today is the first day of October which means that places will be converting shortly to the haunted versions of themselves.  I realized this last night as I drove past the carwash down the road.  The sign in the front read "TRYOUTS FOR HAUNTED CARWASH TODAY."  This carwash does the haunted thing every year but this is the first time I have seen that they had tryouts.  So I have come up with a list of the scariest things you could hear in a carwash to help anyone who might want to tryout. As you read the list be sure to use a scary ghost voice or the throaty voice of Frankenstein.</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm using a course soap!</li>
<li>I won't be using a lambskin chamois!</li>
<li>We don't have a water softener!</li>
<li>You're going to have water spots on your car when you leave!</li>
<li>The wax is drying before I have a chance to buff it out!</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to offer more.  This is just a start.  The auditions are cut throat and you'll need all the help you can get!</p>
