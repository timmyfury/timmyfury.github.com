      By talking to a few other people, it seems that this might work better if you start with the standard one, then cancel it and move to basic broadcast (which is what happened to Mike and I -- we had a beginner deal of ~$10/month, which quickly moved to $40/month, and I'm not paying more for cable than I do for dsl).
      
      It probably also depends on the skill of the cable people in your area, as ours could not find the right cables for our apt. (but the basic broadcast = standard cable is not just a fluke for us, as several of Mike's co-workers got this to work, and no, they don't live anywhere near us).

      How can you get standard cable for ~$9/month?  Ask for "basic broadcast," which is designed for areas where you can't pick up TV signals with an antenna.  In the Chicago area at least, Comcast does not fuzz out all the regular cable channels.  This has worked for me for at least 2 years.
      
      Again, congrats on the new apt.

<p>So I waited an hour and a half for the cable guy to come to my apartment.  Didn't need to be here.  The heavily accented gentleman who took my order on Sunday must have misunderstood what I wanted.  They came in to put in digital cable.  I didn't want it.  I wanted standard.  All I need is CNN, Discovery and the History Channel and I'm set.  So I didn't need to be here when they came in.  No biggy really.  They go to the pole and set me up.  </p>
<p>The point to my story here is that when the guys come in they are telling me I am getting digital cable, I tell them, "No I just need Discovery and the History Channel."  The guys look at each other then look around the place.  Dual screens.  Metal playing. National geographic.  Wired.  Reading about Burning man. Two full bookshelves. SUSE linux book on the coffee table. I know exactly what they were thinking.</p>
