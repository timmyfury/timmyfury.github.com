<p>I talked to my dad last night for 27 minutes and 43 seconds.  I know this because he informed me.  You would have to know my father to really understand that thats probably a calculation he did in his head.  You see my father is a robot.</p>
<p>It's nice to talk to him now and then during the week cause <a href="http://www.qualitydistribution.com/">his job</a> keeps him away most weeks and I only get to see him on the weekend.  He's great to talk to though.  He always has good insight for me on things and unlike me he gets to see the country, at least the northeastern part of it.</p>
<p>I'm rambling again.  I went up to <a href="http://www.weirdhead.org/">my sister's</a> room and I found her pushing a box from <a href="http://www.buildabear.com/">build a bear</a> across the floor towards her bed.</p>
<p>The box was closed and I say, "Hey Marisa, whats in the box."</p>
<p>"Cat," she responds.</p>
<p>Sure enough I look in that box and there's the cat.  Now if you met Marisa you would be enchanted by her charm.  She's incredible, nicer than anyone you have ever met in your life.  But to be honest she is in less the peak physical condition.  She has several physical ailments which make it hard for her to manuever without a helping hand.</p>
<p>How the hell did she manage to stuff this poor cat into this box?</p>
