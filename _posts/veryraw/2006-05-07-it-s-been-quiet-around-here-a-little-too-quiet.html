<p>Its been just under a month since my last post. I've had plenty to talk about but no time to talk about it. Many entries are half written but the time just isn't there.  The semester is coming to a close and projects and finals are wrapping up or looming. </p>
<p>The biggest thing however, is my employment status.  I spent about four and a half years working at <a href="http://www.dccc.edu">the college</a>.  About a month ago we wrapped up a server migration and the abandonment of our old <acronym title="Content Management System">CMS</acronym>.  The site was at a point that I felt we had accomplished something after two years of rebuiling systems and dynamic areas of the site.  We had changed from a tables heavy, javascript heavy design to a lightweight web standards approach.  It seemed like the perfect time to move on.  And I was lucky that the perfect opportunity presented itself at that moment.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago I started working at <a href="http://www.pixelworthy.com/">Pixelworthy</a>.  A young, fun design and development shop in Center City.  I joined right in the middle of an enormous site build.  The schedule has been grueling and oddly satisfying, but I have had little time for myself.  The job is amazing though.  The people are smart and talented  designers and programmers and coders.  I'm lucky to be there and enjoying myself immensely.</p>
<p>It may remain a little quiet around here for another week or so but I'll be back, full steam ahead in no time.</p>
