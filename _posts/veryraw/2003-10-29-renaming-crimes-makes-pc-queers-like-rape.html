<p>So I was listening to the radio the other day and the commentator said, "Something-something-something-burgled-something-something."  Burgle being the act of a burglar.  What the hell kind of word is that really.  I mean do you really think you would be able to take a police officer seriously if you came home, saw a bunch of police action out front of your house and then the officer says, "Ma'am or Sir, your house has been burgled."  Really now.</p>
<p>This leads me to a theory that I have.  Perhaps if we renamed all the crimes in the world with silly names, they wouldn&#8217;t seem so terrible.  We could call rape snorklebonking.</p>
