    content: It was previously on timmyfury.  I have been slowly moving my old entries into this blog.  This really is one of those comments Dad has made that is absolutely priceless.

      I think it's because it was originally posted while I was at field school, so I probably missed other entries too.  
      
      Can you move "Cat in a Box" over with the pictures and the comments?  I really miss that one.
