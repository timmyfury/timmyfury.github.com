<p>Early this month, I went into a tizzy about <a href="http://www.airbagindustries.com/archives/009360.php">Greg Storey's entry about developers</a> and how they are careless good for nothings.  I was irritated at the insinuation that all developers were as careless as the one that he had just had the displeasure of working with.  I have a serious issue with this idea.  I would call myself a developer and I would consider myself consciensious when it comes to not only the markup I am given but, for the most part, even anal about how the markup is formatted in the source.  The implication that developers are careless is careless in itself.  Some developers surely are, but all are certainly not.</p>
<p>My other issue with the assertion is that developer means programmer.  I think that the term developer is a very important term in the web industry.  For the most part, when someone says developer, they mean programmer.  I think this is dead wrong.  A programmer is someone who only programs.  At <a href="http://www.pixelworthy.com">work</a>, I toil away alongside several people who are called designers, but I would consider them developers. Eric Sink explains my feelings best in his essay <em>Hazards of Hiring</em>.</p>
<blockquote title="" cite="http://software.ericsink.com/bos/Hazards_of_Hiring.html">
<p>Although the words "developer" and "programmer" are often used interchangeably, I make a distinction between them. That distinction is the difference between simply coding and being a part of product team.</p>
<p>...in a small ISV, we need versatility. We often need the people on our teams to wear multiple hats, not just write code. In these cases, it is often very important to look for the best developer, and that person is not necessarily the best programmer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Its really important to think of ourselves as more than just designers and programmers. It's important to be developers.  All of us should be developers and all of us should strive to work only with other developers.  Whether your thing is design or programming or css or management, chances are you wear more than one of these hats at some point.  That's what it means to be a developer.</p>
