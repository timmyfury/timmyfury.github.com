<p>You may think that this stuff is all that there is to an iPod.  I wrote the other day that <a href="http://veryraw.com/history/2004/11/ipod-changed-my-life/">the iPod had changed my life</a> and I meant it.  But I haven't gotten a chance to show you all the other good shit that came with it.</p>

<p>There it is! All the stuff. Amazing isn't it?  I'd just like to point out to all of you the best parts of this wonderful action packed little package.</p>

<p>The first was one of my personal favorites.  The box.  Apparently when you get the iPod engraved you end up waiting 4000 years for them to do the engraving.  Doesn't help either that it was freaking shipped from Shanghai.  Although the wait was less strenuous since I could watch every agonizing, creeping moment courtesy of <a href="http://www.fedex.com/">FedEx</a>.</p>

<p>When I opened it I found this delightful little warning about my favorite things.  Piracy.  Piracy is evil and everyone knows it.  Thats why I don't believe in piracy.  There are currently 8726 completely legal songs on my computer right now.  Right.</p>

<p>Anyway I think apple could have been a bit more conservative about the amount of crap they shoved in that box.  I mean really its amazing that they were actually about to send me all that shit for nearly nothing in shipping, but really, how many chinamen did it take to pack that box like that?  I'm a pretty smart dude.  I can't figure most things out.  But I don't have the slightest clue how the hell you got that in there.</p>
