    content: One time Mark and Trish and I were driving through the city and Mark started screaming from the back seat of my car.  I look back and there's a cricket on his knee.  He swats the cricket with a paper towel roll and it jumps into the front seat.  Trish stands up on the front seat bent at the waste, back to the ceiling and jumps into the back seat.  The two of them were screaming like crazy until I pulled over and opened the door for the cricket to jump out.

<p>Trish and I were driving around Media last night in our seamingly neverending hunt for an apartment.  I lean forward toward my steering wheel and in the corner of my eye I see something fly in the window.  It hits my shoulder and I feel it land on my back.  Trish starts screaming, "Oh my god pull over! It's huge!"  I have no idea what the thing is.  For all I know its a freaking vampire bat or a flying rabid baby or something worse.  I start screaming, "Just get it off!" She won't touch it.  </p>
<p>As I start to brake, but while I am still movng, I throw the car in park.  The car comes to a grinding, painful stop and the two of us fly out of the car.  Now the two of us, twitching with a case of the heebie-jeebies are looking all over the car for this thing.  She describes it to me as what sounds like a huge flying roach or waterbug.  It had apparently crawled into the back seat when I jumped out ofthe car.  We couldn't find it.  After about five minutes, standing in the middle of the street in Media with all of the doors of the car wide open we decided toget back in the car and move on. </p>
<p>Twenty minutes later, the thing flies out of the back seat and past Trish's head.  It lands near the windshield then flies to the dashboard.  Trish starts freaking again.  I managed to actually stop the car this time in my panic to get the hell out of the car. Didn't manage to pull off the road mind you, just stop the car.  We are running around the car looking for a stick to use to chase it out of the car.  I find one and it avoids my stick and runs to the other side of the dash.  I was terrifed it was going to run down into the dashboard and lay eggs in the heater or something.  I manage to knock it to the floor then out of the car.  </p>
<p>When the dust settled, we stood outside of the car staring at each other, we noticed that there was a guy, possibly one of our future neighbors, standing in his yard watching the two of us the whole time.  His face had disbelief all over it.</p>
