    content: the real way to become an album listener- vinyl and cassettes. no joy can be derived from skipping tracks on a lp or a tape. you sure won't have that copy of 'crash test dummies' on cassette. plus, you'll amass a collection full of contrived 'value' and 'rareness'.

    content: I would add anything by Modest Mouse as well. But all I own are "Sad Sappy Suckers..." and "Good news for People...", but both of those albums rock my socks. (I would like to "borrow" your Shirley Bassey album. I'd make a swap if need be.)

      If you can find it look for Court of the Crimson King by Crimson King. I think 
      you will find that for something writen and
      produced in the sixties it is absolute percus-
      sion genious.

<p>Long ago when I first started amassing my ever growing music collection (mp3 collection which is nearing 9,000 songs).  I was a song listener.  I listened to individual songs with little rhyme or reason.  In those days my musical taste was, Shall I say, immature and had not reached the level which it is now.  I have become quite a music snob.  Thanks alot <a href="http://iam.thecolossus.net/">Mark</a>.</p>
<p>I digress</p>
<p>In those early days of naivety I had little thought of organization and little conscienseness of what I was listening to.  With 300 songs to browse, there was little need.  As my collection has grown though I have lost track of individual songs and they all become one big mass of data.  The individual song has lost its importance. </p>
<p>Albums have become my way of distincting good from bad.  I search for good albums now.  Any retard with half a brain and three fingers can put out a good song.  It takes a real artist to compose a 12 song masterpiece.  A list of songs which speaks to me and tells me a story.  A piece of works which holds my ever waning attention span.  To move me.  To make me feel something, good or bad.</p>
<p>I offer you this list of albums which I consider masterpieces.  Feel free to offer yours as well.  If you are interested in hearing any of these, let me know and maybe you can <del>download them</del> borrow the CD from me.</p>
<ul>
<li>Underworld - Beaucoup Fish</li>
<li>Lovage - Music to Make Love to Your Old Lady By</li>
<li>Ultraviolence - Life of Destructor</li>
<li>The Mars Volta - De-Loused in the Comatorium</li>
<li>Kid Loco - A Grand Love Story</li>
<li>Shirley Bassey - The Remix Album... Diamonds Are Forever</li>
<li>Venetian Snares - Finding Candace</li>
<li>Coldplay - Parachutes</li>
<li>Radiohead - Kid A</li>
<li>Tom Waits - Anything by Tom Waits, I mean come on, he's Tom Waits</li>
</ul>
