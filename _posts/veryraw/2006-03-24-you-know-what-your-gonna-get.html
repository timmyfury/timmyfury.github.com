<p><a href="http://www.tagworld.com/snakesonaplane">Snakes on a Plane</a>.  You go to a movie with that title and you should already know what you're gonna get.  You're not getting fancy plot or engaging love stories.  You're gonna get Snakes on a plane.  And the chance to hear Samuel L Jackson say stuff like, "I'm tired of all these motherfucking snakes on this motherfucking plane!"</p>
<p>I share Mark's opinion of this movie, "I haven't been this excited about a movie since Lord of the Rings." You can also listen to the story about <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5298003">Snakes on a Plane on All Things Considered</a> and learn more about the power of the webtron and how it made this movie even more awesome Or buy one of the <a href="http://topatoco.com/snakes.htm">Snakes on a Plane t-shirts</a>.</p>
