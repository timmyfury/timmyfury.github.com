<h1>The Special Place</h1>
<p>As I sit here I canâ€™t help but think how great it is.  I have a little place to call my own, a hide-away of sorts.  I spend a lot of time here and I have grown to like it.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s sort of dark here.  There isnâ€™t much light at all.  I would use my lighter but I am afraid that I will set something ablaze and start an inferno.  Thereâ€™s a lot of stuff in here.  I think there is a coat and boots underneath of me.  The tire iron is poking me in the leg and the jack is underneath my rear end.   I think there are some bottles of oil here too.  There must be a leak.  I can feel water sloshing around underneath of me.  Everything around me is drenched.  I shiver every time I am here.  Itâ€™s cold and damp. The smell is a combination of oil, mildew and exhaust.  It makes me a little light-headed but it goes away when I get hit with an overwhelming smell of gasoline.  Even though my friends are all here itâ€™s very muffled.  I canâ€™t hear much of anything.  I can only hear them when everyone gets very loud.</p>
<p>My friends are having such a good time with me here. They are laughing and whooping and screaming and cheering.  All they talk about is how great it is that I am here.  It makes me feel like a celebrity.  The thrill wears off after a while though.  They quiet down and I think they forgot that I am even here.  Theyâ€™ll come back though.  The entertainment is too appealing to them. </p>
<p>I donâ€™t necessarily like it here though.  I donâ€™t have a choice though.  When my friends came to get me tonight, they convinced me to play out a kidnapping scenario in front of a huge crowd of people.  They snatched me up and stuffed in the trunk at the Dairy Queen and sped away.  They promised to let me out, but I should have known that they wouldnâ€™t.  My friends are jerks.  I should expect this sort of thing.  The problem is that they have been driving over curbs and speed bumps for the last hour.  I am getting tired of it.  I am hurt. But they are having fun still.</p>
<p>Most people would say that I am sick for thinking this is a great place.  Itâ€™s terrible, it smells and itâ€™s painful.  They are probably right, but the thing that makes it great is that next time it will be someone else.</p>
