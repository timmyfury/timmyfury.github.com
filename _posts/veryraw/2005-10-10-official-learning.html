    content: You should tell your profs how much you're enjoying the classese.  As a teacher, it's nice to know when you're getting the students as excited as you are about a subject.

<p>Frequently I think to myself that I am just wasting my time by going to school.  This is not to say that the investment is a waste and won't get me somewhere.  I mean that for the most part the things I learn in my IS classes are things I already have a good deal of knowledge about from work or personal reading.  I am mostly self-taught.  I don't think that I am perfect by any means but a lot of my opinions about technology and web development and process are developed based on the reading of many wise individuals and hours  of thinking on my own about these topics, rather than ideas that are forced on me by a select few professors.</p>
<p>I am taking two classes this semester.  Project Management and Database Design.  These are two topics that I have read about excessively.  They are two things that I have thought about at length and they are subjects that I have alot of opinions on (as if there's anything I don't have an opinion about).  Regardless this semester has been somewhat of an eye opener for me.  There are oodles of concepts that I have thought I have understood in the past but by going to class and sitting through it from beginning to end, I am making connections that I haven't made before.  I am learning terms for things and ways of discussing concepts that I could never quite put into words.</p>
<p>My point is that although I have in the past found school a little tedious, this semester is different.  I am learning things that I have already learned all over again for the first time.  I'm going to class and I'm loving it.  There's conversation and debate and I'm loving it.  I just wish I could go back full time so I could get my learn on in a more solid and fullfilling way.</p>
