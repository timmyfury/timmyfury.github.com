<p>I went out the other day and bought the new <a href="http://www.djdieselboy.com/">Dieselboy</a> cd. It's called &quot;<a href="http://www.gracenote.com/xm/pcd/genelect/7c0cc849f2c59d0d97e89c94dab8cd15.html">The 
Dungeonmaster's Guide</a>,&quot; which we all assumed was a reference to <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/welcome">Dungeons and Dragons</a>. Our theory was proven true when we read the insert to the cd.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The aesthetic for this CD is based on a love I have for a classic fantasy roleplaying game called 'Dungeons and Dragons'. I want to use this small space to give proper respect to the friends who joined me on numerous late night 'junk food and jolt cola' - fueled gaming sessions over ther years. 1981 - 1987: [a list of names I don't feel like typing] . 1987 - 1992: [another list which I don't feel like typing]. Thank you guys, I will always cherish the memories. Arctic Whitemace lives on!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also goes on and on about how <acronym title="Dungeon Master">DM</acronym>'s are so talented and how they are so great and how they work so hard. Mark's theory is that he is just fishing for a game. He's kissing the DM's of the world's asses to get them to invite him to the game. Good theory. But either way it's great to see that all the fame that he has gotten from his mad <acronym title="Drum and Bass">D&amp;B</acronym> spinning skills hasn't gone to his head and that his dork roots remain intact. Good man.</p>
<p>On a slightly seperate note and the album is amazing. It is right up there with Dieselboy's &quot;<a href="http://www.gracenote.com/xm/pcd/drumnbassjungle/fde7fae4b1e3725b8c2ad37e2e0ad9b8.html">The 6ixth Session</a>. &quot; Hopefully this one won't suffer the same fate as &quot;The 6ixth Session.&quot; I have to date owned four seperate copies of that particular album and lent each one to different people and have never gotten back.</p>
<p>Go buy it. It's worth the money. It's freaking amazing.</p>
