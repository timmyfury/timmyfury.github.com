      Sort of like an owl!? 
      
      The only way it could look more like an owl is if it were tearing a squirrel apart in it's sharp steel talons.

<p>I was in the kitchen talking to my parents the other morning and I noticed that my mother's stove looks sort of like an owl.  This stove is about 10,000 years old and I think it was my mother's grandmother's.  Regardless, its terrifying to light (with a match) and the thermostat doesn't work anymore so good luck baking or cooking anything.  Anyway.  It looks like a face.</p>
