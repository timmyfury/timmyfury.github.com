<p>For those of you who hit my site through RSS this won't affect you.  I am polishing my new site template.  I have built this one from scratch and spent a lot of time on it.  This is a good one.  There are a lot of things that need to be done to the site though before I can implement it.  Over the next day or so the site is going to be a bit finicky.  Never fear.  I'll be back and polished.  You'll love it.  Seriously.  Be patient.</p>
