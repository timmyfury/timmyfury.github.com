<p>Saturday, Brian, Brad and I tore down my shed.  Brian and I had spent an entire day gutting this shed.  It had pretty elaborate shelving, it was fully paneled, insulated (that was fun) and had electricity run to it.  We didn't know how we should take the roof off.  Brian and I were planning on getting some ladders and taking the roof off 10 feet up.  Leave it to my brother to find a quicker more destructive way to do it.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpV4E7QNtt8&eurl=http%3A%2F%2Fveryraw%2Ecom%2F">Watch and enjoy</a>.</p>
