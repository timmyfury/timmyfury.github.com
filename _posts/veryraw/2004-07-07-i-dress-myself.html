There is a large number of shows on TV right now which mock the habits and phrases and trends of yesteryear. Most of these shows are on VH1 such as "<a href="http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/i_love_the_80s/series.jhtml">I Love the 80's</a>" and the soon to premier "<a href="http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/i_love_the_90s/series.jhtml">I love the 90's</a>", which premiers soon . These shows are great because not only do they make me feel all weepy nostalgic but they mock everything about those times. I know one thing though. I will never be on one of these shows because I have never quite been able to get a grip on style.
