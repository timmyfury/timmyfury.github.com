      There's this one girl that always prefaces here "IT questions" with that... and I'm totally like you - I'm not cocky, and I try to be as helpful as possible.. But this one girl always does that, and I never mind it, because she's kinda cute. So I guess it depends on who keeps confronting you, like that.
      
      Hehe, my "knowledgeable" two-cents, of the day.

      I have no clue how to do portfolio analytics, but I am apparently the smart one because I know computers. No matter that the people I work with got better grades, at better schools. I am the smart one.
      
      <strong>I am not the smart one. You are not the stupid one.</strong>
      
      We have different vocations, and let it be known that I don't even like computers. This comes as a shock to the people I work with everytime I say it. No one should be uncomfortable talking to their technology specialist.

      I think one thing that makes a lot of people pose a question like that is they (we) don't know any better. We've all experienced asking someone a question we were in fact stupid to be asking (like we just didn't read what the message said or clicked the wrong button), and the person we ask is, for some reason, in a bad mood or is busy. Then we'll often get a reply such as "everybody knows that", "how can you not know this" or "figure it out for yourself".
      
      When we've got an answer such as that once or twice we quickly learn it might be better to change the way we ask. Rather than "what does this mean? how do I do this?" we say "I know I'm supposed to know this because everyone else seems to...". People who know nothing about computers see 'everybody else' knows things, and we don't know what is easy and what is not - what 'everybody' knows and what only people like you would know.
      
      
      Now that is said - I don't pose questions like that so I can't say I know why some people do. I mess around, look everywhere and click all the buttons until it either works itself out or blows up in my face.

<p>Although I hate being called a <a href="http://veryraw.com/history/2005/05/information-superhighway/">computer guy</a>, and the assumption that I know about every aspect of computing, I frequently get questions about things that are not in my expertise.  It's mostly because I'm approachable and for the most part I have the ability to answer a question about computers or technology without making people feel like idiots. What drives me crazy though is when someone comes to me and asks me a question, but prefaces the question with, "I know I'm totally stupid for asking this question but..."</p>
<p>This is easily one of the most annoying things in the world.  I would like people to realize that my specialty, the thing I spend nearly every waking moment thinking about and one of my favorite things in the world is technology.  The reason I know how to do all the things they want to know how to do is because technology is not only my job but also my hobby.  I do not know how to teach English to people who can not speak it.  I cannot diagnose sickness and I cannot put an IV in someones viens.  I do not know how to paint or play the piano.  I know technology.</p>
<p><strong>I would like people to realize that a lack of knowledge about technology does not equal stupidity.</strong></p>
<p>I feel that the thought is based in the old IT stereotype.  When the helpdesk first became prominate, they were wizards and gods.  They could make computers do things that others couldn't do.  They took a long time and they were cocky and they made people feel like shit.  This is not the way it should be and for the most part now this is not the way it is.  Helpdesk now is as much help as it is comforting (at least it should be).</p>
<p>I think that IT people in general, whether you be a developer or a networking guy or tech support, should take extra care to make people feel as though its not their job to understand every intricacy of the technical world.  I think that the technologically inclined of the world should adopt the attitude of care and comfort and help the other people of the world to realize that just because they don't know what they are doing does not mean they are stupid.</p>
