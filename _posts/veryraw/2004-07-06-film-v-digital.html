<p>The last time <a href="http://weblog.trivolt.com">Brian Mac</a> was up here from Midland, Texas, we got into several heated debates over the pluses and minuses of digital and film camera's. It irritated me to think that someone so enthralled with all things binary would say that digital was inferior to old school and shall I say out of date. <a href="http://www.timmyfury.com/history/venusandsaturn/#comment261">He recently commented</a> on my <a href="http://www.timmyfury.com/history/venusandsaturn/">last entry about Saturn</a> that its a shame they aren't using real film for the images of Saturn (which I should note I have been more than dissapointed with so far). Never-the less, film would be impossible to use because NASA will no doubt end up losing the Cassini spacecraft in Saturn's gassy body. The comment he made when he was here thought which sticks out most in my mind is this. &quot;In ten years, all of your digital images will be thumbnails. I will still be able to enlarge my film.&quot; I hate you so much.</p>
<p>I have recently been agonizing over what insanely priced digital camera to purchase. I am not sure what resolution to go with and what camera has the fastest write time. All together there are about 10 different features which I have decided are most important. All at the same time having an interface as dumb as my first <acronym title="Single Lense Reflex">SLR</acronym> the <a href="http://www.vivitar.com/Products/SLRprog/slr.html#V4000-50mm">Vivitar V4000</a>. All this agonizing while in the back of my head this comment keeps ringing over and over again. &quot;In ten years, all of your digital images will be thumbnails... In ten years, all of your digital images will be thumbnails... In ten years, all of your digital images will be thumbnails.&quot; </p>
<p>So the question now is. Do I spend a ton of money on an 8<acronym title="megapixel">MP</acronym> digital or do I spend half the money and get a film camera which does nearly twice as much and has a simple interface?</p>
<p>The answer. Both. I will probably end up buying a new slightly flashier film <acronym title="Single Lense Reflex">SLR</acronym> <strong>and</strong> a fancy high megapixel camera. They both have their benefits and it doesn't hurt to have different cameras for different circumstances.</p>
