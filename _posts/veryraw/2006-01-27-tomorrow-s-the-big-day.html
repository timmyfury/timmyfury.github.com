    content: Storm made it through fine if you are wondering.  He's clawless and ball-less and ten pounds lighter.

<p>When I was younger <a rhef="http://veryraw.com/history/2004/05/noticing-haircuts/">when I went to the barber</a>, after he cut my hair he would always say, "10 pounds lighter."</p>
<p>Anyway, tonight we take the cat to the vet and drop him off for neutering.  I just thought it would be funny if after the vet was finished he said the same thing as my barber used to.</p>
