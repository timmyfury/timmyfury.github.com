    content: I love Alton Brown.  He's the man.  However, his recipes for tomato sauce and burgers sans seasoning leave something to be desired.  I still like Rachael Ray, but you're right -- when she does $40 A Day, I've seen her totally fake to like something which is obviously cheap and nasty.

<p>Its no secret that I am a big nerd. I ahve mentioned in the past that <a href="http://veryraw.com/history/2005/07/nerd-live-here/">I don't watch the normal channels</a>. In Delaware County, my channels are almost exclusively between 60 and 70.  I have grown increasingly more fond of the latter two channels in the series.  Food network and Home and Garden network.</p>
<p>One host in particular has caught my eye.  <a href="http://www.altonbrown.com/">Alton Brown</a> has an amazing show called <em><a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/show_ea">Good Eats</a></em>. The show is part cooking show, part science lesson.  Not only does he crash through numerous recipes each show without the grueling step by step, but he gives you the history and science behind whatever he's talking about.    Plus the way the show is shot is a lot of fun.  Jumpy and natural.  Like it was shot with a camera in his own kitchen rather than manufactured in a studio.</p>
<p>I've been watching his new show too.  Its called <em><a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/show_ab">Feasting on Asphalt</a></em>.  Alton and his crew are riding across the states trying roadside foods and telling you about them.  The show is shot in a similar twitchy style as <em>Good Eats</em>.  The great thing about this show is that, unlike Rachael Ray's <em><a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/show_ad/">$40 A Day</a></em>, Alton will tell you when what he's eating is shit.  It's an awesome show.  I've enjoyed it a lot; I think you would too.</p>
