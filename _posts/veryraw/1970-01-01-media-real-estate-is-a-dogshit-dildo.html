<p>As you know, we moved out of our apartment last month and into our new house.  Our apartment was through Media Real Estate.  We received our security deposit check back this evening in the mail and were surprised at the amount of money they took out of the security deposit.  Even more surprising was the itemized list and the values attached to the items on the list.</p>
<p>The list was as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Refrigerator cleaning?  Kitchen floor cleaning?  Bathroom cleaning?  What a total crock of shit.  And don't even get me started on the professional carpet cleaning.</p>
