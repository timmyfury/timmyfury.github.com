<p>Last week <a href="http://www.snooble.com/2006/01/24/firefox-extensions/">Andrea</a> and <a href="http://www.jefflouella.com/byte_this/2006/01/work_and_browse.html">Jeff</a> posted their firefox extensions.  I found a few good extensions that have already become indespensible, so I thought that mine might help.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://downthemall.mozdev.org/">DownThemAll</a> - Lets me download all the media linked on a page.  I certainly would never use this for anything nefarious.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.iosart.com/firefox/colorzilla/">Colorzilla</a> - Select the colors that are used on a page.</li>
<li><a href="http://forecastfox.mozdev.org/">ForecastFox</a> - weather, pretty basic.
</li><li><a href="http://www.boxofchocolates.ca/projects/numberedtabs/">Numbered Tabs</a> - If you hit ctrl+num, you will go to that tab in the browser window. This just adds numbers to the tabs.
</li><li><a href="http://chrispederick.com/work/webdeveloper/">Web Developer Toolbar</a> - A must if you do any html/css.  I wish there was a way yo open the cookies panel from it, but its still pretty awesome.</li>
<li><a href="http://karmatics.com/aardvark/">Aardvark</a> - Builds a little on what the old web developer toolbar did.  I don't know if its useful anymore.  I lets you highlight sections of a page and see what elements they are part of.</li>
<li><a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">Greasemonkey</a> - add behaviors to your browser with user scripts</li>
<li><a href="http://livehttpheaders.mozdev.org/index.html">LiveHTTPHeaders</a> - This is undoubtably the most important extension I use when I am developing an application.  The ability to see everything that's happening is very important.  This will probably become 10 times more important when I start doing Ajax stuff.</li>
</ul>
<p>My new extensions from  <a href="http://www.snooble.com/2006/01/24/firefox-extensions/">Andrea</a> and <a href="http://www.jefflouella.com/byte_this/2006/01/work_and_browse.html">Jeff</a> are awesome.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://andy.5263.org/screengrab/">Screengrab</a> - screenshots of an html page.  Great for circumventing those idiots that try to make it so you can't download from their page.</li>
<li><a href="http://fireftp.mozdev.org/">FireFTP</a> - The integrated browser FTP is vital.</li>
</ul>
