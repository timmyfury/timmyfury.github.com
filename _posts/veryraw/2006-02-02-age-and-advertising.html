â€œLove Those Boomersâ€
MKTG 0081


As aging baby boomers near the age of retirement, they become increasingly important figures in consumer markets.  When this age group reaches a period that they have a larger amount of free time on their hands, they are going to be pouring more of their money into new products and services.  It is important to focus on them in advertising because with larger purses and more time, they are going to make up a very significant portion of consumers.

There are several markets emphasized in â€œLove Those Boomersâ€ which have benefited from a more concentrated focus on the consumers over 50 years.  The most obvious industries are those which focus on health.  Companies like Kellogg and Dove have pushed their products by focusing on how they will help you stay healthy.  By featuring older subjects in their marketing campaigns they attract older consumers.  These efforts are important for these industries in particular because as boomers age they are more concerned with their health than they may have been in the past.  More of this industry should be focusing on this age group, rather than solely featuring 18 year old beauties in their advertising.  Organizations like health clubs and exercise equipment manufacturers could benefit from these methods as well.  Commercials for Ballyâ€™s health club or similar groups regularly feature young fit people, but there may be a heavy desire for older consumers to join, but canâ€™t picture themselves in the gym.

Companies such as Vespa are smart to market to the Boomer crowd.  These consumers have more cash than they may have in past years, and with more time on their hands after retirement they are prime targets for fun products.  Companies such as Apple or other technology companies would benefit from this idea.  Boomers were the first group of workers who had computers involved in their work lives.  By targeting this group with products that may be primarily targeted toward younger crowds, they may find that the boomerâ€™s ability to adapt to technology in the work environment would stretch to their personal lives as well. A company like Apple is a prime candidate for this.  By marketing the iPod and Mac together, they may be able to attract a whole new customer base.  Boomers may enjoy books on tape or music that could be carried where ever they go.  Coupled with products like digital cameras and software packages like iPhoto, Apple could attract customers who need a way to easily take and manage digital photos of their grandchildren or vacations.  This would bring in makers of cameras and photo printers as well.  These companies could highlight their products simplicity and show older consumers using the product with ease.

The most valid point that is driven home by â€œLove Those Boomersâ€ is that Baby Boomers are still a viable market to push products to.  Marketing efforts need to be applied differently to older consumers than they are to younger consumers. Older consumers need to see older models in advertisements to identify with a product.  Advertising which only features younger models serves to alienate the 50+ consumer group.  â€œLove Those Boomersâ€ also points out that Boomers still have a lot of life to live and they need to be taken into consideration as a viable consumer group.

      Love Those Boomers 
      Their new attitudes and lifestyles are a marketer's dream 



      COVER STORY PODCAST


When Vespa Motor Scooters came puttering back into the U.S. market in 2000 after 
a 15-year absence, managers at the Italian company figured their biggest 
customers would be twentysomethings looking for a cheap way to get around. But 
execs at parent company Piaggio noticed something odd as they scootered back and 
forth to their Manhattan offices: The most enthusiastic sidewalk gawkers were 
often aging baby boomers who remembered the candy-colored bikes from their 
youth. It turns out that boomers have lost none of their affection for Vespa. 
Better yet, now they can afford to buy top-of-the-line models with all the 
trimmings. Much to the company's surprise, consumers age 50 and older now buy a 
quarter of the scooters Vespa sells in the U.S. Managers figure that as they do 
a better job of marketing to the group, that portion could grow to as much as a 
third. Those aging consumers may in many ways be the perfect customer for an 
indulgence like a scooter. "The boomers are particularly attractive because they 
tend to have free time," says Paolo Timoni, CEO of Piaggio USA. "They're less 
likely to be raising young children, and their careers are established and 
stable."

The massive postwar boomer generation that drove every significant cultural and 
marketing trend for 50 years -- from Howdy Doody to the Beatles and the Ford 
Explorer -- is defying marketers' expectations about how it wants to live and 
shop. As boomers head into their 60s starting next year, this generation, which 
grew up with the mass market and witnessed the rise of network TV and then the 
Internet, is once again forcing marketers back to the drawing board, this time 
to rethink the rules for reaching graying customers.

But it matters now because half of the 77 million boomers -- people born between 
1946 and 1964 -- will be 50 or older this year. That's the age at which 
marketers traditionally lose interest in consumers, believing that their choices 
about which brand of toothpaste or which car to buy have long since hardened and 
that their biggest earning and spending years are behind them. In the network TV 
business, where marketers are still fixated on viewers 18 to 49, folks older 
than 50 are literally dubbed "undesirables."

Elsewhere, though, attitudes are changing -- and fast. With average life 
expectancy at an all-time high of 77.4 years, more and more Americans over 50 
consider middle age a new start on life. Fewer than 20% say they see themselves 
stopping work altogether as they age, according to a recent Merrill Lynch & Co. 
() survey of boomers. Of those who plan to keep working at least part-time, 67% 
said they'll do so to stay mentally active, and 57% said to stay physically 
active. People now in their 50s may well work longer than any previous 
generation, with more than 60% of men age 60 to 64 expected to be in the 
workforce in 2012, up from about 54% in 1992, according to the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics.

The boomers' collective wallet will only get fatter as they continue working. As 
a group, people age 50 to 60 are flush, with more than $1 trillion of spending 
power a year, about double the spending power of today's 60-to-70-year-olds. 
They're likely to be vigorous consumers as they empty the nest, take on new 
jobs, relocate, support children they had in their 40s, go back to school, start 
a second or third career, remarry, inherit money from their savings-minded 
parents, pursue new hobbies, and tackle the health issues of aging. "Marketers 
are slowly waking up," says Matt Thornhill, president of the Boomer Project, a 
Richmond (Va.) consulting firm. "If you're going to expand your business, you 
will have to market to the aging boomer."

Pitching to folks beyond the traditional cut-off point of age 50 could help 
companies bridge the gap between the boomer generation and Generation Y, the 
group of 74 million teens and young twentysomethings that's almost as large as 
the boomers but hasn't yet reached its big earning-and-spending years. In 
contrast, the group in between the boomers and Generation Y, known as Generation 
X, comprises only about 50 million people. "Gen Y is a big market, and its 
spending power will be even bigger in the future. But what about the shopper 
today?" asks Greg Maloney, CEO of the shopping-center management business at 
real estate firm Jones Lang LaSalle, which is altering the store mix at some of 
its malls to include more boomer-friendly shops.

Figuring out how to reach the new fiftysomethings takes some effort. David G. 
Schreiner, vice-president for active-adult business development at Pulte Homes 
Inc. () and its Del Webb retirement-community division, suspected that many of 
the "retirees" living at his properties, where the average age of residents is 
62, weren't exactly pursuing the tranquil lifestyles that the company had 
promoted in the past. Concerned that Del Webb might be misreading its customers, 
Schreiner last year dispatched staffers up and down the country to interview 
almost 100 Del Webb residents from Florida to Minnesota.

The reports from the field were even more colorful than Schreiner had imagined. 
One Florida retiree had gone back to work driving a boat at Walt Disney World 
and had recently gotten married...at the amusement park. A former telephone 
company middle manager living at a Del Webb development in Northern California 
described her life's mission as being "to teach all the world to dance." She 
leads countless classes and dance events at the retirement community and 
elsewhere. Another Del Webb resident took up propagating water lilies and 
breeding them in the many ponds that dot her development in Texas. Clearly these 
folks weren't just hanging around and playing bingo.

What does that mean for Del Webb's business? Years ago common areas in its 
communities had a "sewing room" or a "computer room." Now, given that residents 
might use an area for yoga one day and woodworking the next, rooms are simply 
named after local landmarks, such as the "Gila" room at the Surprise (Ariz.) 
development, named after a nearby river. Past Del Webb ads portrayed retirement 
as a reward for a lifetime of hard work and sacrifice; photos featured people 
contentedly lounging by the pool. Today, Del Webb presents retirement as a 
second life with ads showing seniors pursuing their hobbies, exercising, 
volunteering, or operating a home-based business. "We have to keep up with 
residents and make sure that we're not building shuffleboard courts," says 
Schreiner, 52. "The War Generation was far more predictable and consistent, but 
this generation gives you a bunch of paradoxes."

Vespa still works hard to create buzz among its 30-and-under customers. But it 
also is pursuing older buyers more aggressively. To increase Vespa's visibility 
among mature consumers, the company has just begun advertising on the Golf 
Course Home Network, a Website aimed at affluent boomers seeking homes near golf 
courses (). It's also pursuing cross-marketing deals with mobile-home makers and 
condominium developers that attract the 50-and-up crowd. To make its scooters 
more appealing to boomers, Vespa has ratcheted up quality and added a full line 
of high-end accessories including leather seats and decorative chrome bars that 
appeal to older tastes and wallets.

Even as companies bend over backward to address older consumers, 66% of people 
aged 50 to 60 still agree with the notion that, overall, "advertisers target 
people younger than I am," according to the Boomer Project. But today's boomers, 
with their numbers, spending power, and high-energy lives, will probably force 
their way on to marketers' radar screens and stay there. "Our generation still 
has more living to do," says Nancy Blaustein, 55, of Walnut Creek, Calif., an 
enthusiastic shopper for all sorts of merchandise from clothes and home 
furnishings to computer equipment and magazine subscriptions. "I'm not ready to 
wind down yet." For those companies targeting the boomers, here are five 
lessons:

I'M A GROWNUP, NOT JUST A BIG KID
Yes, our culture worships youth. But that doesn't mean boomers fantasize about 
being 20 again. In fact, that assumption has caused some notable marketing 
mishaps. In 2001, Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America Inc. began running ads 
featuring people in their twenties grooving to indie rock music. It turned out 
those ads alienated the 40-to-55-year-old customers Mitsubishi coveted. Much to 
the carmaker's dismay, in two years the average age of its buyers had dropped to 
about 35 from 40. That's bad news because 40-to-55-year-olds tend to have better 
credit scores and buy more expensive cars than 20-to-35-year-olds. Mitsubishi 
retooled the ads, casting fortyish actors. "We literally had existing, valuable 
customers who were dropping us from consideration because they said they no 
longer saw themselves in our brand," says former Mitsubishi marketing chief Ian 
Beavis, now head of marketing at Kia Motors America Inc.

Gap Inc. (), too, thinks that aging boomers will continue to be a profitable 
segment of consumers so long as the company doesn't group them with shoppers 
half their age. Four years ago the core Gap brand tried to revive flagging sales 
in part by capturing the 50-plus consumer. An ad campaign using the tagline "For 
Every Generation" featured artsy black-and-white shots of famous older boomers, 
including actors Bill Paxton and Sissy Spacek. But the inclusive slogan and 
mature faces didn't make the Gap brand grown-up.

Most of the campaign still focused on younger celebrities, and Gap's clothes 
themselves remained too bright and skimpy for the boomer body. Sales continued 
to decline. San Francisco-based Gap is now launching a chain called Forth & 
Towne, selling careerwear and casual clothes aimed at U.S. women older than 35 
(BW -- Oct. 17). "All their lives, the boomers have been catered to and felt 
special, and they would like to see something just for them," says Geoffrey E. 
Meredith, president of marketing consultancy Lifestage Matrix Marketing in 
Lafayette, Calif.

FIFTYSOMETHING CAN BE BEAUTIFUL
Companies have traditionally used models in their 20s with dewy skin to pitch 
products made for middle-aged women. The rise in Botox treatments and plastic 
surgery notwithstanding, many consumers experiencing their first liver spots and 
crow's feet are actually comfortable in their skins and pleased to see people 
who look like them in ads. "As you become older, you're clearer and more 
comfortable about who you are," says Lori Bitter, partner at JWT Mature Market 
Group, part of J. Walter Thompson Worldwide. "It's a reality of aging. We want 
the message at eye level. We may not want it sugar-coated."

Portraying advancing age has helped Unilever Group's Dove soap. About 18 months 
ago, Dove market researchers suspected that advertisers were stuck in the old 
habit of presenting only youth and slimness as attractive. To confirm that idea, 
they pored over video clips of commercials and leafed through pages torn from 
magazines, pasting them up into photo collages. And indeed, the result was a 
shrine to the slim, the full-chested, and the young. Then, because Dove is a 
global brand, the researchers trekked across the U.S., South America, Europe, 
and Asia to ask thousands of women of all ages what they thought of the 
portrayal of beauty in advertising. No matter the country, they repeatedly heard 
the gripe that "the images of beauty in ads are unrealistic and unattainable," 
says Dove marketing director Philippe Harousseau.

Capitalizing on that sentiment, Dove turned industry tradition on its head last 
October with print ads using ordinary looking women instead of glamorous models. 
Two of the six shots in the ad exult in advancing age. One shows a 46-year-old 
woman with deep lines around her jaw and eyes and a full mane of gray hair. The 
caption: "Why aren't women glad to be gray?" The payoff so far: In the nine 
months following the launch of the campaign, sales of Dove rose 3.4% from a year 
ago. That uptick sounds small, but it's huge for the static soap category, and 
it exceeds the growth in soap sales as a whole, according to Information 
Resources Inc., which doesn't include sales at Wal-Mart Stores Inc. () in its 
data. Why is the campaign working? "As you get older, fantasy and idealization 
are out, and reality and authenticity are in," says James J. Gilmartin, 
president of ad agency Coming of Age Inc. in Lombard, Ill.

Even cosmetics marketing, which has most adamantly equated beauty with youth, is 
starting to change. Procter & Gamble Co.'s () Cover Girl brand, where women 
older than 55 account for about 20% of sales, has just launched its first line 
of makeup aimed at older women. The name of the product, Advanced Radiance 
Age-Defying Makeup, hints that advancing age can be pretty. And while ads still 
show a stunningly gorgeous face, that face belongs to an older woman: 51-year 
old former supermodel Christie Brinkley. Cover Girl marketing head Anne Martin 
is betting that bringing back Brinkley, who represented the brand for two 
decades until 1996, will help Cover Girl recapture boomer women who were 
customers in the 1970s and '80s. Like many of today's fiftyish consumers, 
Brinkley is known for being energetic and active. "She represents the new 
50-year-old," says Martin.

I'M NOT AS SET IN MY WAYS AS YOU THINK
Many marketers believe that consumers' brand preferences are locked in by age 
40. That might have been true for previous generations. But today's over-50 
crowd is just as likely, and in some cases more likely, as everyone else to try 
different brands within a product category. According to Yankelovich Inc., 33% 
of consumers older than 50 agree that it's "risky" to buy an unfamiliar brand. 
That's less than the 36% of respondents aged 16 to 34 and only a little more 
than the 30% of people aged 35 to 49 who agree with that notion.

In some categories, older consumers are even more willing to brand-hop than 
younger ones. According to a 2004 survey by Leo J. Shapiro & Associates LLC for 
DSN Retailing Today, 48% of shoppers aged 50 to 59 said they would probably 
switch brands of consumer electronics, compared with 40% of all respondents. And 
56% of people in this group would try another brand of health-and-beauty 
product, more than the 51% figure overall.

What gives? That flexibility stems from the fact that today's fiftysomethings 
came of age in the 1960s culture of unlimited possibility. "This group grew up 
in a time when novelty and experimentation were higher on the priority list than 
during the prior generation," says Yankelovich President J. Walker Smith. That 
attitude means a 50-year-old boomer just might try that new product or service. 
On the flip side, such open-mindedness also can make these consumers highly 
unpredictable. Honda Motor Co. () thought minivans were just for 50-and-under 
soccer moms and figured that its boomer customers, once free of the children, 
would move on to its fancier Acura coupes and sedans. But to its surprise, 40% 
of Honda minivan buyers are empty-nesters, mostly boomers over 50 who want roomy 
vehicles to cart around grandchildren, elderly parents, and Home Depot () hauls. 
Honda last fall introduced an upgraded Odyssey minivan full of leather and 
featuring zoned climate control and other pricey features wealthier older buyers 
covet.

I'M REWINDING, NOT WINDING DOWN
For previous generations, age 50 meant, bluntly put, the beginning of the end. 
But today's 50-plus crowd is far more likely to see the two or three decades 
ahead as a second life. Watching the kids leave home, for instance, need not 
bring on empty-nest syndrome. According to a survey last year by Del Webb, more 
than three-fifths of boomers say they're emotionally prepared for the kids to 
leave home, and more than a third believe their marriage will improve after the 
kids leave. "You'll have time to talk to your spouse more, fewer things to argue 
about, and you don't have to have sex in the middle of the night when you think 
the kids are asleep," says Carolyn E. Adams-Price, a Mississippi State 
University psychology professor who has studied empty-nesters.

Seizing on that idea, Pillsbury () last October began airing a TV spot that 
revels in sexy empty-nester coupledom. "We're in this experimental phase," says 
the male half of a fiftyish twosome snuggling on the couch. The couple savors 
Pillsbury's Oven Baked biscuits with dinner, and as the Pillsbury Doughboy dims 
the dining room lights the woman giggles: "There's only so much experimentation 
I can take...at least at the dinner table."

The strategy, Pillsbury says, is to associate the empty nest with a promising 
stage of life. "Marketing to this segment is all about portraying the 
empty-nester in a positive light," says Mark Toth, a marketing manager at 
Pillsbury, a unit of Minneapolis' General Mills Inc. () Pillsbury could be on to 
something: After only three years on the market, its frozen biscuits have the 
largest market share in that product category and sales are up since the 
campaign changed direction.

I WANT TO LIVE LONGER AND HEALTHIER
Health issues weigh heavily on the mind of the 50-year-old boomer. The top 
concern about retirement in a MetLife Inc. () survey was "becoming sick," with 
31% of respondents citing that issue. Drug companies, of course, have always 
tried to cash in on the health concerns of older consumers. Now other kinds of 
companies are joining in.

But catering to health worries isn't as easy as it looks. Long known for Corn 
Flakes and sugary kiddie cereals, Kellogg Co. () in Battle Creek, Mich., in the 
late 1990s launched its "Smart Start" line, designed for older grownups. But it 
languished for years because the packaging, marketing, and product itself 
weren't aggressive enough in promoting specific health benefits. "The marketing 
and ads were generic in the way [they] talked about vitality and vitamins," says 
Mark Baynes, a senior vice-president for marketing. Last year, Kellogg set out 
to relaunch the line. Inside the company, staffers used the term "successful 
aging" as a rallying point.

This time around, Kellogg wanted to target older, health-conscious boomers who 
increasingly see themselves as amateur nutritionists. The revamped line includes 
three varieties: "antioxidant," "soy protein," and "healthy heart." Each 
pinpoints specific health claims. The front of the box from the antioxidant 
line, for instance, says the product can "help support a healthy immune system."

Kellogg doesn't soft-pedal the message. One ad says, for example, that "more and 
more women are hospitalized for heart disease." Kellogg figures its audience can 
handle the no-nonsense tone. "They're more educated on the health risks, and if 
they have a second life to fulfill, they have to take control," says Baynes. 
Since the relaunch early this year, Smart Start sales have risen 48% from a year 
ago, while sales for cereals as a group slipped 0.2%, according to Information 
Resources.

It's clear that the boomers are more comfortable with their age than marketers 
give them credit for. "It'll be cool to be gray," says consultant Meredith. Once 
companies pick up on that, they'll start to see green amid the silvery tones.
