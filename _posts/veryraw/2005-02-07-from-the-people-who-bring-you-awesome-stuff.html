      Sounds pretty spiffy.  You'll have to tell me more about it one day... or I should just wait till some rainy afternoon when it's blustery cold and all, to stay in and check it out myself.  
      
      Ha ha.  Like that'll happen in Puerto Rico.

<p>...another awesome thing.  Those people being the Internet community I suppose.  You'll have to bear with me because I am going to try to explain this properly but I'm not sure how clear I'll be.</p>

<p>For about a year now I have been looking for a way to manage links.  I spend a significant amount of time surfing, that is just reading random things on the web about stuff that may not pertain to anything in particular.  I want to save it, but how.  It's a common problem, I think.  How can I possibly organize my links so that I can find them later.  Furthermore, how am I supposed to access bookmarks at home that I have made at work?</p>

<p>I have tried many solutions to this, the most recent of which is extensive link lists on my blog.  This is equally as inefficient because I still have to remember what I wrote about them so I know what to search for when I look for them on my blog.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="http://del.icio.us/">http://del.icio.us/</a>.</p>

<p>It's not just a cool looking URL.  It's a social bookmarks website. It allows you to bookmark web pages by storing them on your del.icio.us profile page.  Furthermore you can add descriptions and tags.</p>

<p>The tags are the most interesting part.  Add as many as you want, they act as categories.  This allows you to keep track of the links the way you want.  In other words the way you think.  This makes finding them easier later.  It also groups them with other links that might be related.  It also shows you how many others have saved it and allows you to see all other links which have been saved using the same tag.</p>

<p>This tagging is known as folksonomy, a term coined by Thomas Vander Wal.  Basically its a taxonomic categorization system without the strict rules.  Its categorization by free association.  This concept has been used in several Internet applications including del.icio.us.</p>

<p>I have not experimented extensively with this application yet.  I have a few uses for it which I will share at a later date.  Go test del.icio.us out.  You won't regret it.</p>
