    content: "Yeah and a digital camera with GPS built in.  Then you could just mesh the data from your images and the data from your trip to output a huge map with a trail of where you rode and all the images along the way.  Add your credit card data to that and you have a comprehensive log of everything that happened on your trip.  "

      Tim,
        What method do you use for finding the lat and long of your images?

    content: I use greasemonkey to get my coordinates.  Save that you can click the "Link to this page" link and it will be in the url string.  The new interface of geobloggers.com also lets you do a drag and drop.  I used that last night.  Pretty slick.

<p><a href="http://geoblogger.com/">Geoblogger</a> is a site that displays your flickr images on a map.  It knows where to display your images by the longitude and latitude tags that you add to your images.  If you want to know more about the specifics, try the geobloggers website.  Dan says it better that I.</p>
<p>So I've been doing this for a little while now, but a new interface for <a href="http://geobloggers.com">geobloggers</a> was realeased recently, and its really quite nice.  I'm totally loving the way it operates.  Even better is the fellow that mantains the site.  Not only did Dan take the time to answer my messages to him about the site but he went out of his way to show me how to craft the URL's to show my images only and control the way it appears to you.  Dan went way out of his way for someone who is maintaining this site as a hobby and for free.  An upstanding chap for sure.</p>
