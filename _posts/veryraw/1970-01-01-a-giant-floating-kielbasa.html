<p>Yesterday I was walking to my class and I saw this girl standing in the middle of the courtyard holding a string that was attached to an enormous floating sausage.  Seriously.  It was huge.  Like 3 feet around and 25 feet long.  A serious kielbasa. Oh and it was floating....  Like in the air.</p>
