    content: A poorly thought out emacs study is the reason that cognitive psychologists have claimed for 16 yrs that negative transfer does not exist.  Watch me prove them wrong in the next year.

Okay so I don't know if anyone else has this problem.  I spend most of my working hours in command line on our linux servers.  I program directly on the server using <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html">emacs</a> (yeah thats right I'm an emacs man). Emacs is text editor (and more) that can be run nearly 100% using keyboard shortcuts.  I'm a mere novice. Watch Michael in emacs and your head will spin at the rediculous proficiency.  Your all over the place.  <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/cc/docs/ccrl34.html">Look at this list of shortcuts</a>.  I spend so much time in emacs now (40 hours a week) that I have started to try using them in windows.  God thats annoying.
