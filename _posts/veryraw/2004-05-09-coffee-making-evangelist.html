<p>I was in Wawa this morning getting a cup of coffee.  A woman is standing at the coffee pots when I walk up to them and she asks the girl walking by behind the counter if she can get one of the fresh pots.  The girl starts in on this tyrade about how drinking coffee causes stomach cancer and how we shouldn't drink alot of coffee.  The woman who asked for the pot turns and looks at me.I took this to mean that I should speak up.</p>
<p>I thought perhaps a proper thing to do was run down a list of the things in my life which could cause cancer.  Here is a list of causes and possible cancer types.</p>
<ul>
<li>smoking -> lung cancer.</li>
<li>sitting in front of computer monitors -> face cancer.</li>
<li>breathing -> lung cancer.</li>
<li>going outside -> skin cancer.</li>
<li>wearing deoderant -> armpit cancer.</li>
<li>brushing my teeth -> tooth cancer.</li>
<li>handling money -> wallet cancer.</li>
<li>drinking beer -> stomach cancer.</li>
<li>eating cheesesteaks -> stomach cancer.</li>
<li>talking on a cell phone -> ear cancer.</li>
<li>eating corn on the cob -> bowel cancer.</li>
<li>shitting -> prostate cancer.</li>
<li>watching TV -> eye cancer.</li>
<li>walking -> foot cancer.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think worst of all would be the brain cancer that I will someday develope from hearing annoying bitches nag me about getting cancer.  Everything causes cancer.  Get over it. It's the way all the cool kids are dying these days.  Get with the freakin' times already.</p>
<p>Actually I didn't say all of that.  What happened was the woman looked at me and I was like, "Shut up and get us some fresh coffee."</p>
