<p>Trish and I were driving down route 82 in Delaware the other day. The road goes back and forth over this set of tracks and just as Trish finishes saying, "Do you think they use these anymore?" We pass this.</p>
<p>As for the illustration... well, the man is supposed to be blind.  You can't see that in the illustration but he's a blind man pushing that cart down those tracks and up and into the water he goes. Geoff's idea, I only illustrated it for the masses</p>
