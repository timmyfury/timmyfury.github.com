<p>President Bush has set aside, not millions, but billions of dollars in the   war on terror. People don't call it the war on terrorISM. They call it the war   on terror. This concept is redicukous to me. President Bush and his monkeys   have changed the word from <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=terrorism">terrorism</a> to <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=terror">terror</a> because it sounds more marketable. <a href="http://www.defendamerica.mil/">The War on   Terror</a>. It sounds so very cool. </p>
<p>But on my ride into work I was thinking of all the things he has waged war   on in the name of this War on Terror. <a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=osama">Osama bin Laden</a>, <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/ag/trainingmanual.htm">al Qaeda</a>,   <a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=saddam&sa=N&tab=wi">Saddam Hussien</a>, Afganistan and Iraq, the Roadmap to peace. All of these monsters are targeted and I have not seen one bit of money dedicated to the real monsters   of the world.</p>
<p>Every night millions of children around the world are stricken with terror  by the real monsters under their beds and in their closets. When will Bush have   the common sense to extend the War on Terror to those who need it most, the children. Bush's selfish motives have kept federal funding out from under the beds of American children and they continue to suffer while Bush goes after   low level terror suspects like Osama bin Laden.</p>
<p>It's high time Bush sees the real source of terror. Closet monsters, bed monsters and boogiemen.</p>
