      You're impressed that their website is standards compliant?  
      
      Do you really expect a school full of nerds not to have a compliant webpage?

    content: I would have expected the site to be in all Acrobat files.  News Media aren't usually the most user friendly bunch.

<p>After two hard faught years I have graduated.  I have finished two out of three degree programs at <a href="http://www.dccc.edu">Delaware County Community College</a> and next semester I am off to <a href="http://www.temple.edu/">Temple University</a>.  At <acronym title="Delaware County Community College">DCCC</acronym> I completed the <a href="http://www.dccc.edu/catalog/college_transfer_programs.html#computer_information_systems">Computer Information Systems</a> program <strong>and</strong> the <a href="http://www.dccc.edu/catalog/college_transfer_programs.html#business_administration">Business Administration</a> program.  Just under 100 credits.</p>
<p>I'm freaking proud of myself. It wasn't easy working fulltime and going to school fulltime for the last two years but I had some help.  There were a few people at the school in particular that made it possible for me to achieve what I've achieved.  Pedro Navarro and Karen Rege made it possible for me to manuever my schedule between class and work, allowing me to complete my course work.  Eric Wellington with his constant encouragement and ability to deal with 10,000 requests for substituted courses and overriding of placement tests.  Ann Marie Neary for her encouragement and inspiration when I was a know nothing jackass (When I was?).  And of course the never ending love and encouragement of Trish.  She prodded me to apply to Temple.  She forced me to sign up for classes on time.  She listened to me bitch and moan.  And she comforted me each time I had lost hope or direction.  I certainly couldn't have done it without her.</p>
<p>The battle isn't over though.  I start at Temple in January.  I will be pursuing a <a href="http://www.mis.temple.edu/">Bachelors of Business Administration in Management Information Systems</a> from <a href="http://www.sbm.temple.edu/">Temple's Fox School of Business</a>.  I have read some of the course descriptions and I am in love with some of the classes they are offering.  I'll keep you all up to date on the developments as I start there.</p>
<p>As a complete aside though I would like to make special note of the Fox website which is Web Standards compliant.  Makes me love it even more.</p>
