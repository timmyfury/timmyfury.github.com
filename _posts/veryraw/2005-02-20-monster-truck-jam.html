<p><a href="http://iam.thecolossus.net/">Mark</a> and I went to the Monster Truck Jam this afternoon.  It was supposed to be Trish and I but Trish is spending a week in Korea recruiting exchange students for the school.  Great seats they were.  Those trucks are so freaking loud.  I had forgotten how loud they were.  My father used to take me to those like every year it seemed when I was much younger and it seems that every single time I had to get out of there because it was far too loud.  We got two extra seats about 10 minutes in because the guy next to us had to leave with his kid.  </p>
<p>There were three trucks there which deserve special mention.  The first is The Broker.  It was funny because on the side it had a skeletal hand writing "Your policy has expired."  Second was the Safe Auto Minimizer.  What a funny name.  Like minimizing accidents.  Funny.  And then of course the truck that I loved when I was younger.  Grave digger.  I used to root for that truck all the time when I watched it on TV.</p>
