<p>There's this episode of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002JP58Q/102-6907932-0193743">Spongebob Squarepants</a> where Spongebob asks Patrick how they could sell more chocolate.  Patrick exclaims, "Let's get naked!"  That's exactly what I'm doing.  If you're reading this in your feed reader, you won't notice anything strange.  Take a <a href="http://veryraw.com/">click over</a>, and see my site in all its naked glory.  April 5th is <a href="http://naked.dustindiaz.com/">CSS Naked Day</a>.  I've stripped off my design with the removal of a single line and the site is still usable and understandable.  It's the magic of web standards and semantic markup. Enjoy my spectacular nakedness... while it lasts.</p>
<p>Jeff also set up the <a href="http://www.phillystandards.org/blog/2006/04/04/the-pso-is-getting-naked/">PSO to get naked</a>.  Oh god, I'm getting warm!</p>
<p><em>Update: Since CSS Naked Day is over, you won't see my site in all its naked glory.  If you would like to and happen to use <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">the good browser</a>, press ctrl+shift+s and revel in the naked glory.</em></p>
