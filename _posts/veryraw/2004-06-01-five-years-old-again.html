<p>Jarrod, Mark, Geoff, Michelle and I were rolling around yesterday in my parents van (the beast) because my driverside window is broken. Gets fixed tomorrow hopefully and all will be well. Thats not why I write though. We went to one shopping center and spent four hours there. How I don't know, but four hours none the less. Three stores. The third of which was the best. This new store is called <a href="http://www.fivebelow.com/">fiVeBELoW</a>. I swear to you that whent hey were building it Trish and I suspected that it could be a nice restaurant or something. Nope. Been wrong before, I'll be wrong again. It's like a dollar store but not. It's easily the greatest store ever. Tons of candy. Tons of cheap toys. A <a href="http://www.arcadegames.com/ctgy/CocktailTableGame/prod/classic020">table top Pac-Man</a>. Here's what they say...</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.fivebelow.com/aboutFiveBelow.html">

<p>The greatest thing that we got there was <a href="http://www.fundexgames.com/products/?c=22&amp;g=710">these foam darts</a>.There's a thick rubber band through them.  You put your finger through a loop at the end of one of the rubber bands and pull it back like a slingshot.  They fly like mad.  They were two for a dollarat fiVeBELoW.  I bought four and it was the best two dollars I have ever spent.  We used them for like 5 hours total yesterday.  Get some of them.  You won't regret it. </p>
