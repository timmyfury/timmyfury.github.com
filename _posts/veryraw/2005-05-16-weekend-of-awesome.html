<p>I had an amazing weekend.  The synopsis and a bit of detail in bulleted form with a multitude of accompanying links...</p>
<ul>
<li>Dinner at Jarrod's - <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,,FOOD_9936_27966,00.html">pork chops</a> and beer.  <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/timmyfury/sets/345210/">Jarrod ate an apple for us</a>. <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/67493834@N00/">Michelle</a>, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/sunflowerseed/">Trish</a>, Allison, <a href="http://iam.thecolossus.net/">Mark</a> and Lee were also present.  <a href="http://www.victorybeer.com/Beers/SunriseWeissbier.htm">Beer was consumed</a>.</li>
<li>Stop over at the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/sunflowerseed/14081770/">Embassy suites</a> to check in and change for dinner.  Part one of my birthday present. The view from the hotel was awesome as you can see next door.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.zanzibarblue.com/pa/menu.htm">Zanzibar Blue for dinner</a>.  I ordered duck, Trish ordered chicken.  I had the chicken, Trish had the duck.  If you've never eaten with us its quite an experience.  Trish had a Parisian Salad.  After dinner we saw <a href="http://www.dianeschuur.com/content/bio.htm">Diane Schuur</a> with <a href="http://members.aol.com/plabjazz/caribjazz.html">Caribbean Jazz Project</a>.</li>
<li>A nice romantic site in <a href="http://www.ushistory.org/lovepark/">Love park</a>. <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/sunflowerseed/14081618/">Then back to the hotel</a>.</li>
<li>Up in the morning and off to <a href="http://www.philamuseum.org/information/index.shtml">The Art Museum</a> to see the <a href="http://www.virtualdali.com/">Dali Exhibit</a>.  So amazing.  I've seen Dali's work before when I was in Venice, but it was just amazing.</li>
<li>Back out of the city.  A stop at Jarrod's house puts <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/timmyfury/sets/342564/">Trish and Michelle on the trampoline</a> for about an hour.</li>
</ul>
<p>A satisfying weekend to say the least.  Feel free to talk amongst yourselves about how interesting and awesome my life is and I will moderate as I see fit.</p>
