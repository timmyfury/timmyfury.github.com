      Well, if you don't want the RIAA to come a'knockin' on your door, then you should install protowall and run it while you're "aquiring" music.
      
      What it basically does is block "bad ips" from connecting to your machine.
      I've been running it now for about 2 months, and I've logged over 2 million of these bad ip connect attempts.
      
      Another good reason to use it, is that it's free... nothing like free.

<p>While on my three month hiatus from blogging I purchase myself a bright shiny new <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/">40GB iPod</a>. The investment made me a little squeamish due to the $400 investment.  I himmed and hawed for months about the purchase but after selling my 1964 Buick Skylark, I had the money and though, â€œWhy the hell not.â€  So here I am with an iPod.</p>

<p>I had the iPod engraved.  The back says, â€œThe Library of Alexandria, Operation Jail Time.â€  The source of this name is two fold.  The first part is what <a href="http://iam.thecolossus.net/">Mark</a> and I have named our effort to archive all of our mp3â€™s.  The project is named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Alexandria">the Royal Library of Alexandria</a> which held all of the secrets of the ancient world but was lost long ago in barbarian raids.  This name has two meanings.  The first is that it is an amazing collection of music, primarily electronic, and the second is that eventually, we are sure, that the barbarians of the <acronym title="Recording Industry Association of America">RIAA</acronym> will get a hold of us and burn our library to the ground like the Huns they are.  Iâ€™ll write about the collection sometime in the future but this entry is dedicated to the iPod. </p>

<p>The second part of the name plays into the idea that someday the <acronym title="Recording Industry Association of America">RIAA</acronym> will find us and we will spend the rest of our lives paying off the fines that they bestow upon us.  â€œOperation Jail Time,â€ its funny, I'm going to jail, laugh.</p>

<p>As of this morning there are exactly 5500 songs on my iPod (Johnny Rebel free).  When I purchased the iPod I was listening to nothing but <acronym title="Natianl Public Radio">NPR</acronym>.  The rest of the radio had become a vapid wasteland of trash.  I couldnâ€™t stand the incessant yammering about things I didnâ€™t care about.  The problem with listening to <acronym title="Natianl Public Radio">NPR</acronym> was that I was also suffering from a mean case of outrage burnout.  This is the what happens when you are so tired of being pissed off about the status of the world that you cease to care.  Needless to say, I was tiring of <acronym title="Natianl Public Radio">NPR</acronym> too.</p>

<p>The iPod turned my life around.  Really.  After I purchased it I didnâ€™t mind the drive to and from work everyday.  Armed with music that fit with every mood I am always equipped for the drive ahead.  With the drive to and from becoming more pleasant, I was in a better mood when I got to work and performed better there.  This has happened in almost every aspect of my life.  Everything I do is more pleasant because I have the music to match the mood.</p>

<p>Although I was originally very apprehensive about spending as much money as I did on the iPod, I am glad that I did.  Now I realize that its probably the best investment I have ever made.
