<p>I don't know if this happens to anyone else.  It's been an issue for me all my life and I apologize for it ahead of time because this is perhaps too much information.</p>
<p>Sometimes I'll go into the bathroom and I'll lift the seat. As I am sitting down my leg will touch the cold  edge of the porcelin bowl.  I've lifted both the cover <strong>and</strong> the seat.  This really shouldn't be an enormous issue but there's something way back in the back of my brain that totally freaks and my whole body spasms and I arch my back and stiffen up and stand at attention.  My body involuntarily does anything it can to avoid putting my ass on that bowl rim.</p>
<p>It was never really a problem when I was younger because I was young and limber.  Things are different now though.  I'm old and large, stiff and out of shape.  I hurt myself everytime.</p>
