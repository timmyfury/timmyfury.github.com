You've been to alot of places with me. Munich, Paris, Venice and Boston. You were there with me in Texas three times. We've had such good times. I consider you one of my best friends, nay, a brother. Who else would hold my hair all those times I puked out back of The Fort in Upper Darby.

You have served me well through the years. I remember the day when I bought you for three dollars at the I. Goldberg "Going Out of Business Blowout". What an exciting day that was. And now, four years later, your brim is tattered and your middle is saggy, but I see the way those other guys look at you with longing when they walk past wearing their "pre-worn" Abercrombie and Fitch hats. You may smell of petroleum and sweat. Your elastic band may be loose and you may not even really fit my head anymore, but I love you smelly hat and I look forward to many more years together.
