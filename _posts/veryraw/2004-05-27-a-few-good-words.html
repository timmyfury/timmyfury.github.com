<p>All of these definitions are courtesy of <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/">dictionary.com</a> I visit there alot and like I said, I get email from them everyday.</p>
<p>So I had this entry written like three days ago based entirely on what was in my inbox. Then this morning I was reading <a href="http://www.robotjohnny.com/">RobotJohnny</a> and the guy had <a href="http://www.robotjohnny.com/archives/2004/05/mind_your_langu.php">already done</a> this sort of entry. Well not really but close. He did have a good link to an article about a <a href="http://cnn.netscape.cnn.com/news/package.jsp?name=fte/favoriteword/favoriteword">survey done by Merriam-Webster about favorite words</a>.  I had two that were the same.</p>
