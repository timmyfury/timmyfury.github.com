<p>The native Americans just lost a battle in court to force the Washington Redskins to cahnge their name because it was insulting to call them the redskins.  If you ever called a "native American" redskin they would get so pissed off.  So why are they even associating the name with themselves (other than the fact that the helmet has an indian on it).  If I was the owner I would agree to change the name to the Washington Gamblers.  They would probably still be insulted though cause they own casinos too.  Perhaps they could use this top five list of names...</p>

<li>Washington Bead Takers</li>
<li>Washington White Man</li>
<li>Washington Syphilis Bringers</li>
<li>Washington Manhatten for a Nickles</li>
<li>Washington Stop Being So Fucking Sensitives</li>
</ol>
