The conversation starts like this.  "I want a pair of boxers that say 'chmod 777' across the crotch."

To enjoy this concept I must first make sure you all understand the concept.  I'll give a quick rundown for the layman.  Any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chmod">further explaination</a> is on you.

Linux is an operating system based on unix.  chmod is a shell command for the unix-like environment. It is the abbreviation of "<strong>ch</strong>ange <strong>mod</strong>e."  It's used to give different users access to different things in the network environment.  This command becomes very useful in web design when you start doing file manipulation and if you don't understand it you may lose your mind.

There are three user groups, owner, group and world.  These are relatively self explainatory and I am sure you can figure out which each one means.  Then there are three settings which must be taken into consideration when creating security policies.  Read, which give the right to read.  Write, which give the ability to alter the file.  Then there is execute, which as the name implies gives the right to execute the file to a particular user type.

The chart ends up like this.
<table cellpadding="4" border="1" title="chmod chart">
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>owner</th>
<th>group</th>
<th>world</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>read</th>
<td>
<div align="center">4</div>
</td>
<td>
<div align="center">4</div>
</td>
<td>
<div align="center">4</div>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>write</th>
<td>
<div align="center">2</div>
</td>
<td>
<div align="center">2</div>
</td>
<td>
<div align="center">2</div>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>execute</th>
<td>
<div align="center">1</div>
</td>
<td>
<div align="center">1</div>
</td>
<td>
<div align="center">1</div>
</td>
</tr>

You then use binary to figure out the settings. The chart makes it easy. <a href="http://www.intuitor.com/counting/">I use my fingers</a> though. You can check the spots you want rights for and then add the numbers in those columns and voila.  You have your security settings.
You would run the command by typing in the chmod then the 3 digit security setting. Full rights you would type, "chmod 777." No rights you would type, "chmod 000"

Back to the original, "I want a pair of boxers that say 'chmod 777' across the crotch." This would give everyone full access to your boxer shorts.

I saw something intrinsically wrong with this.  When you use chmod on a folder.  Which in my opinion the underwear serves as, you arealso giving the same settings to everything in the underwear.  Therefore if you "chmod 777" your underpants, you are not only giving full rights to the pants, but also the cock, the balls and the anus.  This could possibly offer a serious situation.  I mean who knows what who is going to do to the contents of your underwear once they have full rights.

This idea obviously has some ver significant security holes in it.  Not a very werll thought out plan.  And we wonder why there are so many security flaws in systems today.

My own personal underpants security settings would be "chmod 444."  This would give all the rights to take a peak but none the ability to delete.  Then I would set the contents seperatly.

My penis gets a "chmod 550." You would think that I need full rights.  I don't.  There are very few time when write permissions are needed.  You don't want to end up chopping it off or tattoing it sometime when you are wrecked and stranded in Vegas with four french hookers and a chinamen.  No.  Write privileges can be turned on when they are absolutely needed.  But I have turned them off to avoid serious accidents.  As for giving the group settings a five.  This is a relatively elite group of people.  Girlfriends and doctors really.  They may have equal rights to me.  Everyone else gets nothing.  There will have nothing of strangers executing my penis.

Last but possibly the most important security setting.  The anus.  I give my anus a "chmod 100." This way I may execute it which is obviously a must, But no one will have the freedom to just read and certainly not write to it any time they please.
