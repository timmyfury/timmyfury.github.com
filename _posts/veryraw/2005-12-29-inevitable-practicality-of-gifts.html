      As i was reading this, i thought, 'awesome, a paper shredder'... seriously, even before you mentioned the bit about it meaning you are old. I have carried savings club cards on my keys since i moved out of my parents... its just reasonable to be cheap about some things....
      
      apparently a 'fruit basket' is the action of putting ones genitals on someone's head.... just to let you know.

      I got some gift cards from my parents and my first thought was "Awesome, I can get a new toaster oven!"
      
      The new toaster oven toasts just fine, thank you.
      
      I spent my cash on 5 new CDs. I had to buy something just for the fun of it.

<p>This year was my fourth Christmas with Trish. The first year we were together I bought Trish a gift certificate for sky diving.  She bought me something equally exciting.  The gifts became increasingly outlandish and wild over the course of the next two and a half years.  Nights in fancy hotels, tickets for shows, hot air balloon rides and weekends away were sprinkled in the ranks of gifts.</p>
<p>This was the first Christmas after moving in together.  We laughed the other day after opening each others gifts about how practical the presents have become.  I gave Trish books and movies and a coat rack.  She gave me socks and underwear and a paper shredder.  There was an assortment of other gifts but the overarching trend was practicality.</p>
<p>I have been trying to amass a list of signs that you know you are getting old.  I think that this goes down on the list. Here is wear I stand.</p>
<ul>
<li>You get angry at a pot roast for not cooking properly.</li>
<li>You start carrying savings club cards on your keys.</li>
<li>A paper shredder for christmas gets you excited like toys did when you were younger.</li>
</ul>
