For about three months they have been working on this construction site which   it turns out they are building a storage place on. I have noticed every single   time I drive past that there is this giant chainsaw on the construction site.   So yeah, you're like, "A giant chainsaw, whatever." But I'm definately  like, "Look at the damn pictures." That's a god damn giant chainsaw.

This thing mystifies me. It looks freakin' awesome. It's apparently made by <a title="the Case corporate website" href="http://www.casece.com/index.asp?RL=NAE">Case</a>, I believe its actually a <a title="an example of a trencher" href="http://www.toro.com/professional/sws/loaderattach/trencher/22447.html">trencher</a>. But it certainly looks like a giant chainsaw to me. I mean come on. Look at the picture of Mark right next to it. He's near six foot and he looks like a <a title="a site about little people" href="http://mikesundance.com/midgets.htm">midget</a>. The blade on this thing is like thirty feet long and five foot high.

I will now offer you a few simple scenerios for reasons that you would need to own on of these enormous chainsaws...
<ul>
	<li>"Honey, that tree in the backyard really sizzles my nipples.  Do you think that we could remove it this weekend?"</li>
	<li>"I'm installing these beautiful new French doors in my house but this dang sawz-it-all just won't make it through the walls."</li>
	<li>"My wife is pregnant, traffic is terrible and my monster truck is broken down.  Can I borrow your car?"</li>
	<li>"I'll show those bloody neighbors for playing there music loudly"</li>
	<li>"I'm performing a nation wide survey. Do you have five minutes to answer a few short questions?"</li>
	<li>"Hey John, my carving knife seems to have gone missing.  Could you please offer me some sort of turkey carving implement?"</li>
	<li>"Oh great and wise moat digger.  The Visigoths are advancing on the western stretches of our vast kingdom.  His royal highness has requested you by name.  He desires a moat around the shire.  Can you do it?"</li>
</ul>
You see? The giant chainsaw has tons of useful household applications.
