    content: "I have a book by the name of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0684870673/002-1119285-7410444?v=glance\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"Lies across america\"</a>. It basically goes throughout the states and talks about all of the monuments and the real history behind them. For example, did you know that the largest amount of monuments in america arent of Abe Licoln or even The Old George Washington, but of Albert Pike, the founding member of the KKK. This author also wrote a book called <a>\"Lies my teacher told me\"</a>, which is more of a redocumentation of the American History myth. \r\n\

      But for me this isnt really new news, a function of the school system in any country is to create good citizens of that country and if this means bending the truth a bit then they are willing to do that. What do you think that cult-like Pledge fo Allegiance was for anyway? People condemn hitler for indoctrinating the youth of Germany, but we and every other country does exactly the same thing and have been doing it all throughout history. "

    content: that's right, most of america's past is definitely unsavory, if not barbaric. the country's battlefields and historical sites are more underfunded now than ever. did they teach you about the bonus march in school? in the 30's, at the height of the great depression, ww1 veterans marched into washington dc to collect the bonuses promised them by the government...if their bonus was tear gas, they were paid in full. to teach children about the true history of the u.s. would be much to much for young minds. btw, i like the end quote...jim jones had the same quote framed and hanging above his chair in guyana.

      actually, I did learn about the bonus march in high school..
      
      and by the way, our country does not indoctrinate - that's a gross misunderstanding by people who fail to appreciate the fact we live in the freest country in the world and the sacrifices of those who made it that way.  our country does, though, like every other country, try to inspire patriotism (which I must say too many people here are lacking).  if you want to see some indoctrination, step onto any college campus.. particularly the nice liberal ones out west..
      
      there's no possible way a teacher could mention every bit of information that went on during any given time period.. sure, they leave stuff out, but I for one still thought we went too fast..
      
      I must say I'm surprised that most history teachers weren't history majors.  But, if you think about it, a high school teacher who is covering africa, asia, and south america in one year probably took 4 or 5 semester long courses covering those areas - once again, impossible to teach all the info.
      
      some people just are nver satisfied.

<p>When I was just a wee lad in elementary and secondary school I was more interested in sciences than I was in history.  I'm kind of glad I was though because I wouldn't have learned much anyway. I was talking to my nephew yesterday when he found a coin that Trish had brought back from <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/sunflowerseed/sets/246823/">South Korea</a> a few weeks ago. The information that he's missing about the History of the world astounds me.</p>
<p>In school textbooks the history of the United States looks like this...</p>
<ul>
<li>Christopher Columbus discovers North America</li>
<li>Pilgrims land on Plymouth rock and befriend the Indians there.  The Indians love their new friends.</li>
<li>Ben Franklin and George Washington lead the colonies to victory in the Revolutionary war against the Bristish</li>
<li>Civil War</li>
<li>Abraham Lincoln Dies</li>
<li>Great Depression</li>
<li>World Wars</li>
</ul>
<p>Thats it for the History of the United States.  Nothing else significant happened in over 500 years of history.</p>
<p>I bring this up because I have been watching alot of <a href="http://www.historychannel.com/">History Channel</a> lately.  Two shows in particular have been of particular interest.  "<a href="http://www.historychannel.com/conquest/">Conquest of America</a>" and "<a href="http://www.historychannel.com/global/listings/series_showcase.jsp?EGrpType=Series&Id=14304702&NetwCode=THC">The Conquerors</a>."  These shows have really brought to my attention how many holes there are in my knowledge of US history. Now if I can say this with out sounding arrogant I'll be surprised. If someone as intelligent as I am can be so amiss of information than what is the state of things in the average uninquisitive American's brain?</p>
<p>While I was watching "The Conquerors" last night I saw a parallel between the Conquest of Florida and our present day conquest of Iraq.  There are historical similarities where the White house tells the people and the world one thing when they have a completely seperate agenda at hand.  Perhaps if more of America knew about the past, they would have made better choices in the polls last November, or at least they would be as smart as Europeans are to question what is going on in the government.</p>
<p>I get the feeling that the lack of real history education in American schools is not exactly unintentional.  Although this could be another one of my <a href="http://veryraw.com/history/2005/03/efile-for-free/">conspiracy theories</a>.  This same sort of thing is causing trouble in China right now over the Japanese leaving their past out of textbooks. I think that when you leave a bunch of stuff out and people question their own government a little less and the somewhat unsavory activities of a government are ignored. </p>
