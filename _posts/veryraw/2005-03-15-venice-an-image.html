Trish and I spent <a href="http://veryraw.com/history/2004/01/italian-renaissance-frozen-in-time/">the new year in Venice, Italy</a> two years ago.  It was right around the time that I was getting into design with CSS and I made a page on timmyfury devoted to it with CSS.  That page is long gone but as I work through my archives of timmyfury I have found the old image I made for the top of the page.  I love this image.  I have also included the original that I took from to create this.
