<p>I used to write my own blogging software.  After about two years, i got really burned out, mostly because there's only so much that I can do with the blog idea.  There are only so many things you can add.  In addition, I ended up spending all of my time on that and not as much on things that I really wanted to.  This is when and partially why I switched to wordpress.</p> 
<p>In the working world, you are constantly faced with the decision to build or buy.  There are alot of things to take into consideration when you are mulling over this decision (time, money, resources, urgency).  More often than not, unless you are working for a development firm or at a place with an extensive development team there is a good chance you are going to end up making the decision to buy.  If not for the reasons listed above, simply because you can purchase support and upgrades and increased functionality are added for you with little time.  Plus there is likely going to be a large community already using the software.  In other words, why reinvent the wheel?</p>
<p>We have been discussing build or buy alot in my information systems class and we run into this issue at <a href="http://dccc.edu">the college</a> alot.  Not only do we maintain the main website but we have also started to get involved in other business functions of the school.  We are at the beginning stages but there have already been several times when we needed to make the decision to build a system or buy a system.  It's about 50% build and 50% buy.</p>
<p>My point here is this, the chances that you are going to buy software rather than build it is significant.  The ability to examine a system, figure out how it works, is a very important skill.  Anyone can build their own application from scratch.  Most people can even build a good application from scratch.  But when you walk into a place and you have to sit down at another person's code, the better you are at figuring out what is going on, the more valuable you will be. I'm not saying its fun, I'm just saying its a necessary skill.</p>
