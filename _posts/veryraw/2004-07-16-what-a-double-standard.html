<p>In the photography section of <a href="http://www.bordersstores.com/">Borders</a> you can look at as many <a href="http://www.anseladams.com/">Ansel Adams</a> books as you want, but as soon as you pick up that copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/3936709033/qid=1089986588/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/102-2709788-4295326"> 
Naked Happy People</a>, everyone looks at you like you're a fucking pervert.</p>
