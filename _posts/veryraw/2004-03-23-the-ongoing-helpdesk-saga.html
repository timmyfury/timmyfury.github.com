<p>The following is a conversation, or a paraphrase thereof, which I had at work today with a girl in my lab.</p>
<p>"Do you work here?"</p>
<p>"I do."</p>
<p>"Can you help me?"</p>
<p>"I can."</p>
<p>"I'm having trouble with this laptop.  The screen is all widgy on the right side."</p>
<p>"Is it one of the school's laptop's?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry I can't help you."</p>
<p>"Please just look at it from far away.  Maybe you would have a suggestion for me."</p>
<p>"Okay, no problem but I am not allowed to touch your computer."</p>
<p>"That's fine I just need some advice.  My screen is all widgy."</p>
<p>"Define widgy."</p>
<p>"You know, widgy."</p>
<p>"Oh I see." No idea.</p>
<p>She turns the laptop on after struggling with the electrical outlet for about 5 minutes.  I look at the screen of this laptop and it is destroyed.  It looks like someone hit the thing with a baseball.</p>
<p>"Do you see what I mean?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, it's broken alright."</p>
<p>"Yeah it is.  I don't know how it happened."</p>
<p>"Did you by chance... drop it?"</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>I stare at her and cock one eyebrow.  Scrunching my face slightly like I had just swallowed a gulp of coffee which had been sitting on my desk for a few days.</p>
<p>"So it's not fixable is it?"</p>
<p>"Yeah of course.  For the price of a new laptop you could buy a new screen."</p>
<p>So at this point she is pissed off at me because apparently I was supposed to pull out my magic wand and poof make it better.</p>
<p>"Well if I buy a new laptop is there anything that I can do to prevent this from happening?"</p>
<p>A dramatic pause for emphasis...</p>
<p>"...Don't drop your laptop."</p>
<p>It really honestly seemed like common sense to me, but I think at that point she was on the verge of punching me in the stomach.  And so it goes another day through in the world of a community college library helpdesk technician.</p>
