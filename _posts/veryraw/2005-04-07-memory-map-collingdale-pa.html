    content: I wonder how much trouble I could get in with one of these.  Would be pretty neat to do one after a vacation... or major ground war... to help explain where all you went... especially if you could link to photos you took while you were in the spot (say a link to the fort you built with your stolen fence...)

    content: They linked a Memory Map in <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,67190,00.html" rel="nofollow">this article in Wired</a>. Bleeding edge man, bleeding edge.  Such a NERD.

<p>When google released <a href="http://maps.google.com/">google maps</a> I was blown away.  They've recently added high resolution satellite images.  It's pretty amazing.</p>
<p>Some folks came up with the idea to do memory maps based on the satellite images from google maps in flickr.  You take a screenshot of the map the upload it to flickr and add notes to tell stories about your neighborhood.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/timmyfury/8769296/">Check out my memory map!</a></p>
