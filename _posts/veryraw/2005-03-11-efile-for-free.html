      sorry Pennsylvania doesn't work with it.  
      
      Inuit is very sneaky about this, but for free it's worth the hassle to find it!

      The irs.gov site has a list of other companies that offer the free file: http://www.irs.gov/efile/article/0,,id=118986,00.html
      
      Most offer the federal return for free, and charge for state.  A few do both returns for free.

      As anthonyk notes, there is a whole raft of places to file free. The IRS did have a debate about doing a public site of their own, but it wasn't just TurboTax who objected, probably. The compromise is that almost all major tax preparation vendors have a free-filing option, but each one develops its own qualifications for that program. The IRS site lets you find one that you fit.
      
      If anything, Intuit deserves some credit for keeping the program going in the face of the new IRS flagging requirement:
      http://www.usatoday.com/money/perfi/taxes/2004-01-09-efile_x.htm
      
      Other vendors dropped out this year rather than open up their customers to extra scrutiny. 
      
      The problem the IRS has is not an easy one, as electronic filing is the method of choice for tax scammers, e.g. people who file for thousands of dollars in Earned Income Tax Credits to which they are not entitled -- for instance, by claiming a relative as a dependent. Scammers can file, get a loan on the refund/credit, and disappear before an human eyes at the IRS catch the fraud.
      
      That said there's a lot of problems with the free filing program from the consumer perspective:

    content: Grr. Intuit are weasel-bastards, and their filing UI is lousy. But it's still better than paper, so thanks.

    content: If you need a 1040EZ free version, you can also check out http://www.snaptax.com. It's also from Intuit and I believe they only charge for e-filing.

      The Freefile initiative is ok, but can be complicated and not exactly "free". Most of the Freefile software charges for important stuff... and most use your personal information to corss market ou -- that is, send you lots of SPAM and use your email and address to send you ofers for their other products.
      
      I think a better option is to use one of the low-cost e-file companies, like www.Taxhead.com  Their tax software is totally free and they charge only a small fee to e-file (I used coupon code TAXSALE and got eFile for $9.95).

    content: I've been filling by efile, since it started but always for free. I will not pay to send a few numbers to the IRS to get money they owe me. With the new 50,000 limit to file free, I will be going back to mailing my return.  I hope the IRS sees a decline in efiling this year.

A few weeks ago Don sent me links to sites that will allow you to efile your taxes for free.  The federal tax program is from turbo tax.  It's a free version of the program you would buy in the store, but free.  

Don explained that the Fed was going to develop a free efile site because its so much cheaper when you efile than paper file.  <a href="http://www.taxfreedom.com/">TurboTax</a> threw a fit because it would destroy their business.  They came to an agreement that <a href="http://www.taxfreedom.com/">TurboTax</a> would develop a free version instead of the government, then they just don't advertise it.  

The <a href="http://www.taxfreedom.com/">TurboTax</a> page is a bit tricky though.  They do the federal return for free, but they will try to charge you for the state.  When I did my returns I accidently did my state on the <a href="http://www.taxfreedom.com/">TurboTax</a> page and then it tried to charge me before I could ship my Federal return.  If it does this, go back to before you did the state return and skip the state and it will remove the charges and you'll be able to complete your return.  

To do your state return go to the <a href="https://pa.direct.file.state.pa.us/authentication.asp">states website</a> to file.  It's free there.  I only have the Pennsylvania site though.  Sorry <a href="http://www.greasyvalley.com/">Chad</a>.
