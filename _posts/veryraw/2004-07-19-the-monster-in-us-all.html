<p>I made this a few month's ago as part of a design I was working on. I have since abandoned that design but the graphic remains.  I like it alot and I thought I would share it with you after reading <a href="http://weblog.trivolt.com">Brian's</a> friend Rob's blog last night and he did <a href="http://obnoxio.us/archives/2004/07/clones.php">an entry with a collage</a> he did. I still may use it in the redesign I am currently working on but we will have to see how it fits.</p>
<p>These are two pictures of me taken on the same day when I was a child.  I meshed them together to make them look like one and the girl in the background is my sister Marisa.  Although I removed alot of things from these images, I thought it would be appropriate to leave her in. I am calling this one "The monster is us all."</p>
