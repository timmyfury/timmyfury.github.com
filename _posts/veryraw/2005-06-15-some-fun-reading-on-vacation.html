    content: "You should read <i>The Universe in a Nutshell</i>. Stephen Hawkings realised that <i>A Brief history in Time</i> was a bit difficult for the layman to digest and thus wrote this different approach to it. In my opinion it is a much more fluid book and helps you understand basic concept before building upon it. I also have the book on cd if you want to borrow it, read by Simon Prebble (a nice even tempered british voice, that you just assume knows more than you because of its reasonableness). "

      I have a <em>The Universe in a Nutshell</em> but never gave it a chance because I assumed it would have that same "You are nothing" effect on me.  I had a hard time with <em>A Brief History of Time</em> (perhaps it was due to activities at the time) because of the scope of the book and how insignificant one life time really is in the grand view of time.
      
      I may give <em>Nutshell</em> a shot.  I haven't felt nearly as insignificant as I should in a long time.

<p>As mentioned before, I was on vacation last week.  Amidst all the sun and fun with the Ellers in Orlando I managed to get through an entire book.  I mentioned this fact to Mark the other night in Borders and when I tld him what my <em>fun</em> reading on vacation had been he nearly passed out from laughing.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1400045509/qid=1118880773/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/102-3675225-1108125">Electric Universe : The Shocking True Story of Electricity</a> was a great book. I'll give you a minute.</p>
<p>Although I enjoy science, I am not much of a scientific reader.  That is, I don't buy books on scientific theory because if the science is too heavy I lose interest too quickly.  I read <em>A Brief History of Time</em> but I got more out of <em>Who's Afraid of Schrodinger's Cat</em>.  Not because it was better, just because it was written in chunks that were more easily digested.  Regardless, this is partially a science book.</p>
<p>It's also a history book.  This is the reason I bought it.  The delicate weave between history and science is very enjoyable.  It reminded me alot of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0393324826/qid=1118881976/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/102-3675225-1108125">Stiff</a> (which is one of my favorite books all time)(although this one didn't really come close).  The best part about this book though was that it had a third layer that history/science books haven't had in the past for me.  Electric Universe had personality. I mean personality of the books subjects. </p>
<p>I have always wanted to know more about the figures in my history.  I've always wanted to know what these guys were like.  Who were their friends and enemies.  What did they do for fun.  Insecurities? Fears? Ultimate goals and interests.  Electric Universe offered that extra piece of the puzzle that I yearn for. Pick it up, read it, enjoy it and thank me later.</p>
