<p>I have noticed that the hatred of windows has been waning (at least it should considering Windows XP is a relatively solid OS). Although Bill Gates is still absorbing and elimintating the competition it was brought to my attention that he is quite the philanthropist. The <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/default.htm">Gates Foundation</a> has dumped millions into scientific research, particularly into Malria research.  The concept is great because he is privately funding these scientific campaigns which eliminates red tape caused by government or conservative research organizations.  Just when linux kids thought they were winning the battle in world hatred for Bill Gates, He goes and helps a third world nation.</p>
<p>I said on the 10th that Howard Dean was from New Hampshire.  I was wrong.  Vermont.  He's from Vermont.  I was reading about the Free State Movement and had New Hampshire on my mind.</p>
<p>Last I would like to note that Kill Bill is the most violent movie ever made.  It even startled me.  So much blood.  Like fire hoses of blood.  Every five seconds.  It was good though.</p>
