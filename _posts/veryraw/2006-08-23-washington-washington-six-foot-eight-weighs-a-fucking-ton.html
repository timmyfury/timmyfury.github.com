Those who know me know that <a href="http://veryraw.com/history/2005/07/nerd-live-here/">I am a big fan of history and the History Channel</a>.  However, <a href="http://iam.thecolossus.net/">Mark</a> sent me a video yesterday that early made me choke on my <a href="http://veryraw.com/history/2006/08/struggling-with-my-inner-nerd/#comment-1869">historical fiction</a>.  This song, about George Washington is what history education should be.  My favorite line is "... Got a pocket full of horses, fucked the shit out of bears...".  Classic.  Go watch it. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc9y5ayeeb4">George Washington</a>.
