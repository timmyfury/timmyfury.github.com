    content: Ha Tim, that's awesome!  Have you checked out the Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator (MSKLC)?  Mark pointed me towards it.  It's been invaluable for creating the alternate keyboard layouts for my dissertation, but I bet it'd have a bunch of fun applications too.

    content: your clearly insane, but you realise where this must go? a body-suit computer with sensors on your limbs to create sounds based on hand gestures, maybe a set of buttons on your chest for background music.

<p>For Christmas, my parents bought me a wireless keyboard and mouse.  Its awesome.  I have loved every minute with it. It makes it easier to keep my desk clear and lets me site nearly anyway I want in my room without being held back by my cables.  I digress.   The keyboard also has all these extra buttons to bring up email, messaging, control music.  There are five extra buttons on the left hand side of the keyboard.  They are able to be assigned to do anything you want them to do.  I have chosen to make them my sound buttons.  Using sounds from <a href="http://www.a1freesoundeffects.com/">a1 free sound effects</a> I have assigned them to play a different sound each when I press them.  This comes in handy in conversations while I'm at my computer.</p>
