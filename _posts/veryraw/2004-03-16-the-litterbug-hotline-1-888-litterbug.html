So the other day I get home and my Mom hands me a fist full of mail.  There are two letters of minimal importance and then there is this letter from the DMV.  For those of you who know anything about my past, particularly in the vehicular sense, can probably guess that I am at this moment staring at the letter spreading peanut butter in my pants.

The envelope is about two inches thick.  I'm like, "This can't be good."

I open it up and I find this letter from the litterbug hotline. I'm reading it in complete disbelief for two reasons. First, there's a such thing as the <a href="http://www.dep.state.pa.us/dep/deputate/airwaste/wm/Litter/Facts/Report.htm" title="The Litterbug Hotline Information Page">litterbug hotline</a>. And second, who the fuck in their right mind would report me to the <a href="http://www.litterbug.org/index.htm" title="the litterbug hotline website">Litterbug Hotline</a>?

My first instinct was to blame one of my friends.  Naturally since just about everyone I know  is a complete jerk, this is not out of the realm of understanding.

Second accusation was for my father.  I called him this morning to tell him the story and   he was in the middle of teaching a safety course to a bunch of truckers, whom I might add I could hear chuckling in the background.  Actually, when I first called and said I got a letter from the DMV he said, "Does the letter say that because of your recent speeding issue in Georgia,  we believe you should get your <acronym title="Commercial Drivers Liscense">CDL</acronym>."  This got a good reaction   out of the drivers.

So anyway to round the story out and finish up. The reason why the envelope was so thick, was not because of a pack of septa tokens. There was a trash bag in the envelope too.
