    content: Do you mean just acronyms or any tech-related abbreviations? Because, yeah, I am nerdy enough to make the distinction :\

    content: BTW, IMO, I think you have some good points. I think tech-related aconyms are better to use than "general conversation" ones - like those two I just used. Now... THOSE acronyms, I can't stand. WTF??

    content: Have you ever heard someone actually say "ell oh ell" in real life? Like we're sitting at the bar and someone makes a joke and another friend chimes in with "ell oh ell." Not THAT'S just something that's a WTF moment.

    content: I also really don't like tech acronyms that are "pretended" to be words - such as MySQL - some people pronounce "My-Sequel." Or XAML is sometimes pronounced "Zammel." Sheesh. Is it too hard to just say each letter? It's lazy and it sounds like a foreign lagnuage.

    content: Matthom, if you <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/mysql" rel="nofollow">consult the almighty answers.com about MySQL</a> or SQL, the mashing of these letters is perfectly acceptable, especially for programmers.  As proven by Philipp Lenssen in his essay <a href="http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2005-08-24-n14.html" rel="nofollow">Why Good Programmers Are Lazy and Dumb</a>.

<p>Acronyms, particularly technology related acronyms should be used with great care. Using technology related acronyms have a few possible effects. I've made this useful table for you to tell whether you should use them or not based on the knowledge level of the user and recipient and the effect it has.</p>
<table cellpadding="5" border="1">
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <th>User knows the acronym</th>
    <th>User does not know the acronym</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Recipient does not know the acronym</th>
    <td>User totally looks like a pretentious asshole. Recipient is not impressed</td>
    <td>User looks like a pretentious asshole. Recipient is not impressed</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Recipient knows the acronym</th>
    <td>Good conversation may ensue. Neither is impress by knowledge of acronyms 
      used rather by insight into particular topic</td>
    <td>User looks like a complete moron and a fake to boot.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>I feel similarly about acronyms as I do about the terms <a href="http://veryraw.com/history/2005/05/information-superhighway/">information superhighway and computer guy</a>. If you don't know what they mean, they aren't for you to use.  As you can see by my handy chart above, in no case are acronyms impressive.  The only person that has ever been impressed with acronyms is your mother and thats not because it makes you look smart.  Your mother was also proud when you started going poopee in the potty.</p>
