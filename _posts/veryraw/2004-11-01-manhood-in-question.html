      It does however make you smell like a girl after she's been working out. So you get stuck in a erotic feminine fitness cloud all day. This has obvious, sometimes unpleasant results.

You may think that wearing woman's deodarant would make you feel more feminine.  It doesn't.  But is sure doesn't make you feel like more of a man.
