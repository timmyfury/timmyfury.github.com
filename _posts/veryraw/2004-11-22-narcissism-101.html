    content: this reminds me of a guy i used to work with, john hall. his number was 9- it was his birthday, daughters birthday etc. he even had a tattoo of the number 9. he was also a diehard denver broncos fan. a couple of years ago, we were having a beer at this bar when the football game came on- ny jets vs somebody. i voiced my lewd opinion about the jet's mothers, when john started cursing  loud enough to get us kicked out of the bar. it seems there is a john hall who is a kicker for the jets, whose number is nine. another case of shitty coincidence gone wrong.

    content: the worst part of googling my name is that the third one down starts off "it seems geoff kershaw owed the taxman some money.." the first time i read this, a cold feeling shot up my spine, and i almost jumped and ran out the house. thank god it wasn't about me.

      I don't know what is creepier... the fact that there is a song about Geoff or the results for my name...

      <li>debra is pregnant
      <li>debra is not the least bit prejudice
      
      I swear, none of those are true!
      
      But these ones are amusing...

<p>In my never ceasing narcissism I have done what every self obsessed freak does at least once a month.  I have <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22timothy+crowe%22">googled my name</a>.  I have used quotes to ensure only matches for my entire name, <code>timothy crowe</code>.  Here are my results.</p>
<p>In the first page of results, there were two hits to pages that were actually me.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://veryraw.com">veryraw.com</a> - My very own blog</li>
<li><a href="http://www.gawds.org/showmember.php?memberid=245">gawds.org</a> - My profile at the Guild of Accessible Web Designers.  I am member 245</li>
</ul>
<p>Then there were countless questionable results. </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/filmography.html?p_id=272107&mod=films">A film director</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.gettextbooks.com/isbn/075067198X/">An author</a> - There were alot of results for this fellow who has written many books in criminology</li>
<li><a href="http://www.trinityrep.com/index.cfm?Action=About.Display&PageName=TCrowe">An actor for the Trinity Reportory Comany</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.dailycal.org/article.php?id=8831">A victorian in drag</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.locateadoc.com/directory.cfm/34/IL/Chicago/2">A dentist</a> - I practice Implant Dentistry in Chicago.</li>
<li><a href=http://mentalhelp.net/books/books.php?type=de&id=499">An Evironmental Zoologist</a> - I have strong opinions about evolution and I studied guineafowl</li>
<li><a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~langdongoff/crowe-geneweb.html">A dublin man</a> - born in 1803</li>
<li><a href="http://staff.business.auckland.ac.nz/t.crowe">Programme Co-ordinator</a> - of the The University of Auckland Business School.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.mopie.com/sims/simdex.html">A sim</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.psal.org/psalsports/player/psal_playerprofile.asp?cid=248811721&csport=028">A high school basketball player</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The strangest result I got though was an article called<a href="http://www.providencephoenix.com/theater/other_stories/documents/03162957.asp">Living Proof: Trinity journeys to the center of the mind</a>.  It's about The guy about who does theater for the Trinity Reportory Comany.  In the notes about this play it says it was directed by Brian McEleney.  I did theater in high school with <a href="http://macweblog.blogspot.com/">Brian McElaney</a> not <a href="http://www.trinityrep.com/index.cfm?Action=About.Display&PageName=BMceleney">Brian McElaney</a>, but still wierd</p>

<p><a href="http://www.googlism.com/">Googlism</a> has also compiled <a href="http://www.googlism.com/index.htm?ism=Timothy+Crowe&type=1">a similar list about me</a>.  Googlism is awesome it searches you in <a href="http://www.google.com">google</a> then compiles the results and tells you what <a href="http://www.google.com">google</a> thinks about you.</p>
