      I'm a snob. I don't go out of my way to watch wrestling, but I have been known to, on occasion, watch that sordid soap opera of male drama and agression.
      
      It's better than reality TV.

I am horribly guilty of this.  When I am about to talk about something I heard on NPR, I make sure everyone listening hears that I listen to NPR.  Trish says that people who listen to public radio think they are so much smarter than everyone else.  Its true.  NPR listeners are total snobs. So this morning on my ride to the barbershop, they said one of the reports was brought to us by "Wrestlemania 22", I nearly drove off the road laughing.
