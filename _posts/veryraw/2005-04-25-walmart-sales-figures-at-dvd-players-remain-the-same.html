      I guess what has me in all this is the record companies havn't learned a damn thing.  People don't want to pay more to listen to music, no matter how you package it.  Anyone who has ever taken an economics class would realize that if the alternative is free, you'll make more money if you drop your prices.
      
      Charging per track was a terrific idea... and major labels should have jumped (should be jumping) to follow that idea.  If nothing else it forces the artists (and the labels) to put forth more quality music and not fill out albums with crap to keep from overrunning the charts with singles.

<p>On Morning Edition this morning I heard <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4618061">a story about the music industry's latest attempt to curb file sharing</a>.  The dual disc.  A dual disc is a double sided disc that features the  music on one side and video features on the other.   The idea is that by offering additional content on the second side of the disc, people won't download the music rather than buy it.  The biggest benefit they think is that the discs use existing technology and the consumer will not need to buy anything to use them. </p>
<p>There are two major drawbacks I see with this technology.  First of all the discs are thicker than a normal cd making it difficult for older cd player to read.  The second one is that the "additional features" that the music industry is offering are completely worthless to most consumers.  Personally I buy a cd for music.  I don't want video of my favorite band.  How many times can you possibly watch a video of a band?  How much value does this really add.  More over, the discs are more expensive which makes me want to buy them less.  </p>
<p>They are basing their concept on that of the movie industry's bonus features concept for DVD's.  Bonus features on DVD's are lame.  I don't buy DVD's for bonus features.  In fact I avoid them at all costs.  If I have a choice between "Maximum Overdrive" and "Maximum Overdrive: ultra-platinum super sweaty Emilio Estevez edition with 2 more hours of hot gas pumping action and outtakes" I'm not sporting the extra 10 bucks to see that hot piece of meat fill more trucks with gas.  I buy a DVD for the movie.  I buy a CD for the music.  All that extra crap is in the way.</p>
<p>The worst thing about it is that some artists are embracing the idea of the dual disc.  Bruce Springsteen's newest album is being released exclusively on dual disc.  I'd like to know if Bruce has really thinks that his aging fan base is going to embrace it along with him.  Besides that fact, what makes Bruce think that he's good enough to even try something new like this.  I would expect that this will hurt his sales.   I suppose we will have to wait and see.</p>
