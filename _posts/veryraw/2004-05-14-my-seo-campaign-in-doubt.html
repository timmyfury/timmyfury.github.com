<p>About 5 months ago I read a few things about search engine optimization or SEO.  I went on a SEO campaign on both <a href="http://www.weirdhead.org">Weirdhead.org</a> and <a href="http://www.timmyfury.com">Timmyfury.com</a> in an attempt to siphon some extra hits from people who do searches for things that might lead them to my page.  This also coincided with my new found addiction to <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/">web standards</a>.</p>
<p>My main source of inspiration, if I should call it that, Was an article on <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/seo/">A list apart</a> and this checklist from <a href="http://www.submit-it.com/subopt.htm">Submit-it</a>.</p>  
<p>Never the less, I am still waiting for some evidence of the benefit of my SEO campaign and its relevance in the area of search. In fact, Weirdhead.org has not benefitted in the least.  This is made apparent in the fact that it doesn't even come up on the first three pages when you do a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=weirdhead">Google search for weirdhead</a>.  Furthermore, when you search for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=link:http://www.weirdhead.org"> backlinks to weirdhead</a> nothing at all comes up and I have certainly linked to it being that it is my other site.  What I find most interesting though is that timmyfury.com appears on the first page, twice, when you do this search.</p>
<p>I have only noticed one difference relating to Google since I went on my campaign.</p> 
<p>In the five month period since I started SEO campaign my <a href="http://toolbar.google.com/">google toolbar</a> page rank has gone from a 0/10 to a 4/10.  I was curious as to if these two facts were correlated in anyway.  It turns out that they are not.  In <a href="http://www.iprcom.com/papers/pagerank/">Ian Rogers article about Google page rank</a>, he explains that the page ranking is solely based on back linking.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.iprcom.com/papers/pagerank/">
<p>PageRank is one of the methods Google uses to determine a page's relevance or importance. It is only one part of the story when it comes to the Google listing, but the other aspects are discussed elsewhere (and are ever changing) and PageRank is interesting enough to deserve a paper of its own.</p>
<p>PageRank is also displayed on the toolbar of your browser if you've installed the Google toolbar (<a href="http://toolbar.google.com/">http://toolbar.google.com/</a>). But the Toolbar PageRank only goes from 0 - 10 and seems to be something like a logarithmic scale:</p>
<table title="google page rank">
<tr><th>Toolbar PageRank(log base 10)</th><th>Real PageRank</th></tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td>0 - 10</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>100 - 1,000</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>1,000 - 10,000</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>10,000 - 100,000</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>and so on...</td></tr>
</table>
<p><em>source: <a href="http://www.iprcom.com/papers/pagerank/">The Google Pagerank Algorithmand How It Works</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It turns out that my Google page rank has more to do with the amount of content on my site then my SEO campaign or my seemingly painful obsession with web standards.  Although Google page rank has only slight bearing on your Google listing overall it does show the importance of frequenting other blog sites like this one and commenting.  Getting your name out there seems to be the best way to improve your Google page rank.  A small site like mine depends mostly on the word of mouth of other small sites in my overall Google listing.</p>
<p>As an aside to this, I noticed that Google itself has a 10/10 google ranking on the Google toolbar. Yahoo and MSN both have 9/10 ratings. I am curious as to why this is. If Google page rankings are based on links, and if as Ian Rogers said the Google page rank is based on backlinks, then since Yahoo and MSN have a far greater amount of countent shouldn't they have a higher page rank? I may be jumping to conclusions about MSN and Yahoo having more content, but they seem to. This fact makes me question <a href="http://www.google.com/googleblog/2004/05/some-disturbing-results.html">Googles statements in their blog</a> about not being swayed. <a href="http://www.google.com/explanation.html">They stated that their results are based 100% on their algorithms.</a> I am curious.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that Google was the only search engine I used for my obsrervations; half because I am obsessed with Google and the other half because I am lazy.  Try some searches out.  Let me know what you find. See if any of my most frequently discussed topics come up in Google.</p>
<p><em>I would like to note that my statistics class has come back to bite me in the ass.  I worked pretty hard in the class and got a "C."  Some may say that sucks.  I was so excited because I thought I would fail for sure.  Now I don't have to take the course again.  In this entry I linked to some pages that used some statistical concept and terms that I had on many occasions said, "I will never use this crap."  I would like to apologize for these statements.  I used to say the same thing about certain classes in high school and was promptly proved wrong the day I started programming.  I would like to be able to say that I will never make a statement like this again.  That will never happen.</em></p>
