<p>This weekend Trish, Jarrod, Mark, Code, Crissy, Michelle and I went to <a href="http://www.worldchampionshippunkinchunkin.com/">punkin chunkin</a>.  Hella fun.  Jarrod rode the mechanical bull.  He looked like he was drunk while he rode the thing.  Oh wait.  One of the catapults launched a pumpkin into the crowd.  didn't get anyone though, unfortunately considering how retarded everyone below the mason-dixon is.  We actually saw a guy with a huge swastika tattoo on his arm.</p>
<p>The new site design is done as you can see.  Inspired by <a href="http://weblog.trivolt.com" class="blog">brian mac</a>.  He turned me onto design with CSS which I owe himn greatly for.  I will be finishing up the site sometime this week.  the graffiti board works but the cartoons and the history don't.  Gimme time.  Never fear.  Check out <a href="http://www.weirdhead.org/">weirdhead.org</a>.</p>
<p>Don't forget to vote tomorrow.  I know it's not a big election but if you don't vote then not only do you give up your right to talk about politics and the state of the nation, but you also give up your right to oppose chemical castration as punishment for those who shirk their civic duties.</p>
