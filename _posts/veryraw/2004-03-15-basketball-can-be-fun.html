<p>Trish and I went this weekend to see the <a href="http://www.harlemglobetrotters.com/" title="The Harlem Globetrotters Homepage">Harlem Globetrotters</a>. It was so fun. Probably one of the most entertaining things   I have seen in a long time. They did the old confetti trick. This is where they   pretend to throw a bucket of water on the audience but its full of confetti. I think one of the funniest things was when they were running down the court   and they threw the ball to the ref. I could be one of the refs on that show.   Mr. Popular, one of the players, came out in the beginning and said, "before   we get started, we would like to thank our sponsor, Burger King, for allowing   us to eat delicious Whoppers." I thought that was funny. </p>
<p>There was this group of High school age kids that performed a dance thing at   half time. It was certainly interesting. There's nothing quite like half clothed   high school girls throwing themselves around and rolling on a basketball court.   Each one slightly out of step. None of them really knowing what the hell is   going on.</p>
<p>The other group that was there was this acrobatic group <a href="http://www.capitolint.com/mapapavarietybio.htm" title="The Flying Mapapas Information page">The Flying Mapapas</a>. They were awesome. They reminded both Trish and I of this   acrobat group, <a href="http://www.hebei-acrobatic.com/english/f_jianjie.htm" title="Hebei Acrobatic Troupe of China Hompage">The Hebei Acrobatic Troupe of China</a> that performed in the <a href="http://www.ringling.com/explore/133/" title="the Ringling Brothers Hompage">circus last year</a>. They were freaking awesome. They built these huge towers out   of themselves. Tres Bueno. Stacking ontop of each other and jumping through each other's legs. I thought they were amazing.</p>
<p>In other stuff, I have made some changes to the site. They are small and you   may not even notice them. They are purely logistic. Although I have added the   ability to give your homepage when you comment.</p>
