    content: Geroge King is the name that all these viagra emails are sent from.  Actually there are several but I thought George King was an appropriate one to single out.

<p>I am writing in response to your emails.  It was strange to hear from you regarding this matter since I don't  remember mentioning a problem with this to you.  I have been really busy with school and work and everything else so I haven't had a chance to get back to you.  I feel that Viagra is the wrong dietary supplement for a virile twenty-four year old male.  I'm not interested.  Although if at any point you find anything that will give me less erections at inopportune times, please feel free to contact me again.</p>
<p>Best regards<br />
Timothy</p>
