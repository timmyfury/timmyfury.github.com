    content: "You have got me really keen on the idea of printing an album.  I think I would rather have a set of books, rather than one large tome, however... mostly because I think it would be easier to add to later on in life.  Also, my life has been so segmented.  For instance, I'll want an album of my family photos to date... but might not want a coffee table book full of photos of my ex laying around during my next marriage.  Probably better to start another album.  \r\n\

      Have you looked into short run printing enough to know what the costs are like or what the minimum runs are?  Who would you even go to for a short run four color leather bound book?  "

Brian, this would be very handy for your idea of having many ablums.  I'd be interested to see if they would offer some variety of binding options.  Who knows though when this will come out.

<p>In <a href="http://veryraw.com/history/2005/07/laying-out-a-photo-album-setup/">the setup to this idea</a>, I explained the monstrous task that I was facing.  The archiving and eventual laying out of thousands of images into comprehensive annotated album is no simple task.  I may have a working plan for solving this issue.</p>
<p>The first part involves <a href="http://flickr.com">flickr</a>. Using their developers API, an application, web-based or stand-alone, would be developed which would allow you to look at your flickr photostream in chronological order (as opposed to date uploaded order).  The application would allow you to do the following things.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that the date taken information attached to the image was correct.  This can be done in flickr but by viewing them in chronological order would allow you to ensure images flow in time.</li>
<li>Correct and elaborate on captions tags, and titles.</li>
<li>Define tags.</li>
</ul>
<p>Define tags may not be the right wording.  Rather than define I should say tell whether they are people, places, things or descriptions.  This is important later.</p>
<p>The key to this application is to focus on metadata.  The more clear your data is now the better your final product would be.  With that information, the application would output an XML file with all of the information in it.</p>
<h4>This is where the idea gets bit hairy</h4>
<p>With the file outputted with the flickr information, a template of some sort would be created to lay all of this information out into quark or inDesign. Rules would be set for how to show captions and titles and dates.  The template would have to know which categories of tags to display, people and places, or just places, or just people, How large the largest images are allowed to be.  Whatever.  There are probably already examples of this somewhere.  I don't know.  I'm a web professional not a print designer.  Then the tags would be used as an index so you could figure out what pages in the book each tag appears on.</p>
<p>When printed and bound this would create an all inclusive album of your images and details in chronological, look at it with your kids on the kitchen table book.  It creates a history, with details of your family and your life.  Then a disk could be included with the high-res original of each image organized into folders by page if someone wanted to have a printed picture.  But it allows you to have a real, tangable, actual photo album that pictures won't fall out of and get misplaced.  The details are all there and no one will forget whats in the pictures.  Not to mention, if you have a family the size of mine, it would be easy to print a volume for my brother and sisters, parents, whoever without too much effort.  With on-demand printing, this would be rather easy.</p>
<p>The point to all this is that although flickr may not be perfect, what I am trying to do is get all of my images in one place, with proper information.  Then I can work with it however I want.  I have no doubt that someday I will want to abandom flickr, but by then I would hope I have this project long finished.  Saving my memories, not just for me, but for my children and their children too, thats what the intent is</p>
