Well it turns out I was right.  Apparently <a href="http://veryraw.com/history/2005/01/decaf-jihad/">there is something seriously wrong with decaf coffee</a>.  <a href="http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=3035336">A study was released at the American Heart Associationâ€™s Scientific Sessions today that states that decaf may raise the risk of heart disease</a>.
<blockquote>Decaffeinated â€” not caffeinated â€” coffee may cause an increase in harmful LDL cholesterol by increasing a specific type of blood fat linked to the metabolic syndrome, hints a new study presented at the American Heart Associationâ€™s Scientific Sessions 2005.</blockquote>
