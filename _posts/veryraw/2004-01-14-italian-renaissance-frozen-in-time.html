We came back from Venice 2 weeks ago. Being the bum that I am I haven't posting anything about the trip. So here's a bit of a story. New Years Eve was possibly the most exciting part so I'll start there.

Trish and I had just finished dinner and we walked to the Piazza di San Marco. It's a square at the heart of Venice that's about the size of a football field. Three sides are surrounded by archways with columns on each side. On the fourth side there is the Basilica di San Marco and a bell tower which is about twice the size of the basilica. We figured that if there was going to be a Penn's landing style celebration somewhere in Venice, this would be the place.

I ventured toward some polizia (police) to see if I could get the low down on what would happen there that night.

"Parlo Inglesay," I say. You'll have to forgive the spelling of my Italian. I don't speak it, so I sure in the hell can't spell it.

"A little"

"Sweet. What happens here at midnight," I say. I figured if anyone knew the police would know.

"Nothing," replies the officer with a smirk.

"Nothing?"

"Nothing, you night as well go home."

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/timmyfury/8469373/" title="Photo Sharing" style="float:right;padding:5px 0 5px 5px;"><img src="http://photos8.flickr.com/8469373_24926c935a_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Toilette" /></a></p>

I was so confused. I wasn"t sure if he was screwing with me or if the wine was playing tricks on my head. "What do you mean by nothing?"

"I mean nothing. No people, no fireworks, nothing."

"Oh sweet, so there's fireworks!"

Another officer joined in on the conversation. "I believe he said nothing."

"Is there anything going on in all of Venice?"

"Nothing." Again with nothing.

The other officer chimed in again, "Perhaps some private party now and then but otherwise, everyone in Venice is in bed by 10." A little English, eh? Enough English to fuck with me I suppose.

"So there's nothing," I figured I would give it one more shot.

"After 1am there is nothing."

At this point Trish says to me, "Cops are the same no matter where you go. They're just messing with you." So I thank them for there time and we walk away not sure what the hell is going to happen.

Thank god Trish was there cause I would have left. I thought they were dead serious. So we walk around a bit longer and get a cup of coffee and eventually I buy a bottle of champagne for later that evening. About 10 o'clock rolls around and we find ourselves a step in the square to sit down. Fifty feet or so from us there is a group of what I thought were about 15 year olds drinking wine straight from the bottle and setting off small time fireworks. Sparklers, spinners and the occasional pathetic bottle rockets. Nothing big. What was interesting though is that the police were standing right there and they didn't say a word to them.

10:15 a middle aged German couple sits down on the other side of our arch they break open a bottle of red wine and start drinking. Trish and I are doing our slappy act and they are laughing at what we say. So I take a chance and low, they speak English, better then me might I say.

I pop open the champagne and Trish tastes it. "It's poison," she says. So who gets to drink the entire bottle himself.

11:15 rolls through and I am finished the bottle of champagne. I get up to throw out the bottle and bum a cigarette and by the time I am back there is a South African family sitting to Trish's right and an English couple to her left. Both spoke English which was convenient cause after a bottle of wine at dinner and a bottle of champagne in the square, I'm surprised I still could.

The Englishmen, the South African father and myself proceeded to rip on each other's governments for the next 45 minutes. All good natured of course.

11:30 there are about 2000 people in the square. They are walking through the square lighting m-80's and dropping them on the ground. Zero regard for anyone standing there.
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/timmyfury/8470886/" title="Photo Sharing" style="float:right;padding:5px 0 5px 5px;"><img src="http://photos7.flickr.com/8470886_2ec343a7fd_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Distant pigeons" /></a></p>

11:45, now there are about 3500 people. Three circles have formed and people are throwing fireworks from the crowd into the center of the circle. Trish and I are amazed by this all because the police are still standing right there.

At midnight the crowd started whoopin' and hoppin'. One of the circles has been absorbed and the remaining two have grown to about 100 feet across. Now they are setting off fireworks. Not fire crackers. Full on Fireworks. I mean like the Penn's Landing kind. I mean the 150,000 dollar display kind. I mean the $200 at South of the Border kind. I mean the "night in jail just for having them" kind.

The really loud ones that they usually launch really high up and they still wrack your body when they explode. They were just lighting them and throwing them into the middle of the circles. They are launching the full size starburst fireworks, you know the really colorful big ones, right from the edges of the circle. They were exploding literally 100 feet over our heads. They were bouncing off of buildings and exploding.

As people finish their wine they threw the bottles into the center of the circles. There were wine bottles flying into these circles from forty or fifty feet back. There were people running practically naked through the circles with sparklers that looked more like huge flaming red torches.

Now its 12:45 and Trish informs me that she can't feel her feet anymore. It was probably about 15 degrees out and we had been outside since about 8:00. So we start to leave which is probably just as well because on the way out I notice that the police are still just hanging out but now they are all suited up in riot gear. I'm sure that the Americano's would be the first to have their heads bashed in at 1am when all the action apparently stopped.
