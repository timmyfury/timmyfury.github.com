    content: In the anti-virus section you may want to add configuration and updating to said application. For example, real time monitor should be enabled and the thing should scan emails and all downloads. The virus definitions and latest patches to the av program should be downloaded and applied using the automatic update function. This goes the same for all other anti-spyware/adware applications. Also, windows updates, get em, get all of em as often as you can. Set the update manager to do automatic updates, this works better on a schedule if you dont have cpu cycles to spare during the time you use the pc. thats all i can think of

    content: You may wish to mention for those with broadband Internet that they should acquire a low cost <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?id=1051384473833&skuId=4634168&type=product">broadband router</a> which has a built in <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/f/firewall.html">firewall</a>.  This will protect you computer from many viruses, Trojan horses as well as hackers. Many viruses and Trojan horse programs sit silent on your machine and suck away resources sending spam. Others use open ports to infect your computer and steal confidential information. This would be a good investment for anyone concerned about their computer's health. The average suvival time of a virgin PC once connected to the Internet is about <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/08/17/1347214"> 20 minutes before the first infection</a>. Here is a link to some good instuctions on <a href="http://www.sans.org/rr/whitepapers/windows/1298.php"> Surviving the First Day with your new Windows XP installation</a>.

    content: I think a common mistake many people make is providing their email address to just about anyone or any site that "requires" it. People need to know that alot of the spam you get can result from being sloppy with your email address.

title: HELP! - Windows Security Checklist
published: false

---

<p>I need some help.  I created this thing last night and today I got alot of great feedback from specific people I have sent it to.  I need everyone's help now.  This could potentially save a lot of people the trouble of fixing other people's computers because it would give them a place to send them to find some information to help.  It's a windows security checklist.  It covers anti-virus software, pop-up blockers,  anti-spyware and some other stuff.  Leave me comments. Thanks.<p>

<p>You can find a full, properly styled version of this page on my <a href="http://faculty.dccc.edu/~timothy/windowssecurity/">dccc homepage</a></p>

<h1>A few simple steps to a happier, healthier computer!</h1>

<h2>What are we going to do?</h2>
<p>Maintaining your computer is easy.  There are a few simple things which you can do to keep everything in proper working order. This list does not require any special computer wizardry.  I've received a hundred kajillion request for assistance from people who are frustrated with what their computers are doing.  Follow these simple steps and you will find yourself a happy existance which is spyware free, spam free, and ad free. Be patient and don't get discouraged. Good luck.</p>

<h2>What do I do?</h2>
<h3>Run Windows Update</h3>
<p>You will need to use Internet Explorer for this.  Open Internet Explorer, go to <a href="http://www.windowsupdate.com">www.windowsupdate.com</a> They will most likely ask you a bunch of questions, for example, 'Do you trust Microsoft?' or 'Do you want to give Microsoft permission to?'  I am paraphrasing but you will get the option to click <i>Yes</i> or <i>No</i>; choose <i>Yes</i>.  If the options are <i>continue</i> or <i>cancel</i>, choose <i>continue</i>.</p>
<p>Once the page opens you will have two main options, <i>Express Install</i> or <i>Custom Install</i>.  Choose <i>Express Install</i>.  At this point you will see a green bar moving across the screen.  This is Windows Update examining the configuration of your computer.  This is probably the only time you ever want a website examining your computer's configuration.</p>
<p>When the results of this search appear you should choose the <i>Install</i> button on the right hand side of the page. You can rest assured that this method is installing all of the most important and sritical updates that Microsoft has released for your version of Windows</p>
<p>Do whatever Windows Update instructs you to do.  Be patient.  Read the instructions and messages it gives you.  This is not difficult. You may have to run this three or four times after restarts to get all of the updates if you have never updated before.</p>
<p>I suggest this be done at least once a week or setting Windows update to <i>Automatically download and install updates</i>.  Setting this is easy and can be done from the <a href="www.windowsupdate.com">Windows Update</a> page.  This will help you from suffering from horrible flesh eating virii.</p>
	
<h3>Get some anti-Spyware software.</h3>
<p>Spyware is software that is installed on your computer without your knowledge.  Spyware is angry software that can perform any wide variety of tasks.  Spyware can collect what you type.  Spyware can collect passwords.  Spyware can collect your credit card information, your social security number or worse the addresses of naughty sites you might visit.  I'm not telling you this so you leave the internet and never come back.  It's important to know about this so you can protect yourself.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html">Spybot</a> is an excellent <strong>free</strong> anti-Spyware program.  Download this program and run the installation.  Very straight forward and easy to use.  When you run Spybot, you will need to use the <i>search and destroy</i> feature. It will help you eliminate both spyware and, our next enemy,	adware.</p>

	
<h3>Adware.  The most annoying part of the internet.</h3>
<p>Spam is irritating.  The only thing more annoying than spam though is pop-up advertisements.  There are several solutions to this plague upon your house.  Half of your pop-ups are probably caused by programs called adware which have been installed on your computer in a method similar to  the way Spyware is installed.  The differences are important though.  Adware's only objective is to annoy you with its advertisements.  <a href="http://www.lavasoftusa.com/">Download Ad-Aware</a>.  This is a program which finds the adware programs in your computer and removes them.  It also serves as anti-spyware. This program is very easy to use and self explainatory.</p>
<p>The other half of your pop-up problem is surely provided by the pages you visit.  If you insist on using Internet Explorer, install the <a href="http://toolbar.google.com/">Google Toolbar</a>. It has a built in pop-up blocker and really helps fight this problem. Although if you take my next piece of advice you won't need a search toolbar or a pop-up blocker because thats all integrated into <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a>.</p>
	
<h3>The browser is the proof in the pudding.</h3>
<p>A significant portion of the problems that I have heard about on computer has to do with the browser that you are using.  If you are using Internet Explorer you are opening yourself to vulnerabilities.  <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Download Firefox</a>.  Use Firefox. Never deal with these issues again.</p>
<p>I switched to Firefox about eight months ago and haven't looked back since.  I have not had the same problems I had prior to using Firefox and the only explaination is that Firefox is omnipotent. I could tell you about all the wonderful features of Firefox and all the reasons why you should switch but <a href="http://browsehappy.com/">it's already been written</a>. You should read up and then switch.  It will save you alot of grief.</p>
<p>If you are using Outlook or Outlook Express for your email you should switch to <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a>.  It's Firefox's sister email program.  Again you wont regret it. <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/why/">Read why you should switch to Thunderbird</a>.</p>

<h3>The last bits... virus protection</h3>
<p>I start by saying, "I have never had anti-virus software and I have never had a virus."  <del>Screen goes blank and Tim screams... KHAAAAAAAN!!!</del> You may want to look into a virus scanning software.  My father uses <a href="http://www.symantec.com/index.htm">Norton Anti-Virus</a>.  The College uses <a href="http://www.mcafee.com/us/default.asp">McAfee VirusScan</a>.  My father has never steered me wrong but he	doesn't have the technical saavy of an entire IT team.  You be the judge.  Like I said I have never used one but I think they are important.</p>
<p>If you are lookinf for something of the <strong>free</strong> nature you can download the <a href="http://free.grisoft.com/freeweb.php/doc/1/">AVG Anti-Virus program</a>. Not only do they provide free virus protection software but they also ofer free updates.</p> 
	
<h2>So what's the bottom line?</h2>
<p>So the bottom line is that if you do all of the things I have written about you may still get a bowel wrenching computer virus.  You may still have to deal with pop-ups and you may still risk getting hacked.  The chance is always there but these will significantly decrease those chances.</p>
<p>When you are surfing the internet <strong>use common sense</strong>.  If something seems to be shady, it probably is.  Don't download files from websites you aren't familiar with.  Don't accept email from strange email addresses (my email address used to be mulefritters@yahoo.com, that's	sort of strange).  Don't download attachments from people you don't know.  Read the error messages that appear.  Don't just click <i>okay</i> or <i>cancel</i> assuming that you are answering the right question.  It's better to read a pop-up and answer a question correctly than to assume and end up with a piece of software on your computer that you don't want.  You may not know exactly what they mean but usually if you give it that good old college try and use your intuition you will be able to tell whether it's good or bad.  Good Luck and happy browsing.</p>
<p>This checklist is inspired by Jason Kottke.  His recycled <a href="http://www.kottke.org/04/09/windows-security-checklist">Windows Security Checklist</a> assisted in creating this expanded and more extensive Checklist. Michael Zaleski and Donald Sloat were also a big help with his free versions of some of this software. Notable help was also provided by Ed Eckel, Mark Platt and Lori Wushensky.</p>
