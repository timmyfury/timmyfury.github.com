    content: i really like the banner design on the top of the page. It really helps me open up my mind and expose parts of me that are hidden in dark places. The color scheme really broadens my horizons and allows me to accept new and bigger things than ever before. BWAHAHAHAHAH

<p>Last week at <a href="http://www.dccc.edu/">the college</a> we unveiled the redesign that I have been working on for about two months.  The actual aesthetic was designed by an outside consultant.  The purpose of the redesign was to make the site more closely match the printed marketing propaganda that the college gives out.  Its branding, nothing new and I'm not sure why it hadn't been done before. </p>
<p>For Michael and I though the redesign offered us a chance to clean up alot of things that had been irking us for a while.  Here's a list of the goals that we made valient efforts to accomplish in this redesign, then I'll get to the point of the entry.</p>
<ul>
<li>Eliminate the javascript dropdown menus and replace them with a leaner, meaner web standards based menus.</li>
<li>Simplify the logic in the template helping the page load faster by eliminating steps.</li>
<li>Minimize the page size of the page by cutting images and bloated javascript files.</li>
<li>Recode the site with xhtml and css to make it 508 compliant.</li>
<li>Remove some static html pages and replace them with dynamic database driven pages managed by administrative modules.</li>
<li>Unify identical information in multiple areas to draw from a single source creating more consistent content.</li>
<li>Pay greater attention to semantics in markup by using tags for what they are intended (tables for tabular data, headers for headers, lists for lists) to improve access, searchability and indexing.</li> 
</ul>
<p>So thats the short list.  In preparation, we changed about a thousand small things along with spreading content control across the college allowing everyone to maintain their own content. All in all, we cut the load size from nearly 1 meg to around 70k.  A sizable difference.</p>
<h3>Get to the freaking point!</h3>
<p>The graphic design consultant that designed the new site gave us a layered photoshop file with the artsy part of the site.  They failed to address things like links and headers and images.  I was given nearly full freedom to come up with these myself.  After careful consideration I chose the visual styles for the varying elements of the page that you see now. In addition, they didn't address the fact that a dark blue background makes for nearly unreadable copy.  This is what led to the severe difference in the appearance of the homepage and the subsequent interior pages.</p>
<h3>Enter the criticism</h3>
<p>Before telling you what our number one criticism was, I will say that even those who gave us this feedback did like the site overall.  The largest majority of the criticism was that the fonts were too large.  The headers of each page in particular.  The copy on the pages is 16 pixels.  Sixth level headers are also 16 pixels although bold.  From there the size climbs 4 pixels each level up.  This puts the second level headers (the pages headlines) at 32 pixels (a far cry from the 50 pixel font I use on veryraw).  My reasoning for selecting such large fonts is rooted in the fact that our institution markets itself to a widely varied age group.  Our 70 year old students may not be able to read the 8 point font that our 18 year old students can. </p>
<p>I received an equal amount of i-can-finally-read-the-sites's as I did big-fonts-look-bad.  If I need to choose a camp to appeal to, I will pick the one that benefits based on greater functionality and usability rather than the one that losses based on a matter of personal preference.</p>
<p>For more information on why you shouldn't use painfully small fonts, visit the <a href="http://usability.gov/guidelines/fonts.html">US Department for Health and Human Services</a>.</p>
<p>To sum it all up, small fonts suck.  I won't try to claim that this is the perfect design.  It's far from it.  There are at least 10 problems with the style that I can list off the top of my head which make the site difficult to use.  None of them is the size of the fonts.</p>
