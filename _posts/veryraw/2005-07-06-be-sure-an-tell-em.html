      I've been using Dreamhost for almost 3 years, but I don't "kiss up" to it as much as some do... Obviously, they get money if somebody signs up via them - but I still don't believe in doing that type of thing on a constant basis.
      
      In the past, I've recommended it in posts (like Keith did), but I try to keep it to a minimum.
      
      I think Keith could write that cows are flying, and people would believe him.

    content: You'll have to admit though, the guy's got alot of good stuff to say. Four sites worth of good stuff to say to be exact.  I can barely fill one site with good stuff.

    content: Oh yea - don't get me wrong, I didn't mean to sound negative. I just think it's funny - the power of some blogger's words.

      Pee-wee: Some night, huh? 
      Large Marge: On this very night, ten years ago, along this very stretch of road in a dense fog just like this. I saw the worst accident I ever seen. There was this sound, like a garbage truck dropped off the Empire State Building... And when they pulled the driver's body from the twisted, burning wreck. It looked like this... 
      [Turns to Pee-wee and makes grotesque face] 
      Pee-wee: Aaaaaahh! 
      Large Marge: Yes, Sir, the worst accident I ever seen.
      
      Oh, that movie is comedy gold.

<p>I was just reading this entry on <a href="http://www.7nights.com/asterisk/archives05/2005/07/dreamhost-on-rails">asterisk</a>.  He's pimpin' <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/">dreamhost</a> again.  Everyone who uses it does.  I'm thinking of switching there myself.  I'd like to be able to run a few domains on the same account and testing new languages wouldn't be horrible.  Plus god help me if I had the amount of storage available that they offer. I can't do it though (leave the comment that is).  I always feel bad about it cause I hate senseless comments so much.</p>
<p>Anyway, everytime I see someone pimping dreamhost on I want to leave a comment like "Be sure an' tell 'em, Large Marge sent ya!"  I'm sorry its just what I think of.  And then I picture that face.  Large Marge's face.  And I laugh so hard. I loved that movie and that part in particular was like the single greatest moment in horror history.  If you have no idea what I'm talking about go buy Pee Wee's Big Adventure and enjoy.</p>
<p>While I've got your attention, go read <a href="http://iam.thecolossus.net/?p=92">Mark's entry about our conversation this morning</a>.</p>
