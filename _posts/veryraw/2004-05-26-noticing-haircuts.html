    content: You have a haircut every single week? I mean seriously... every week? Do you enjoy them a lot or is it simply because you like your hair short? Or you like the guy?

    content: Apples, it's all of the above.  It's the barbershop experience, its the haircut, and the need for short hair.

<p>Every Friday morning I get up at the buttcrack of dawn and drag myself over to the barber shop to get my haircut. The same guy has been cutting my hair since my first haircut almost twenty-two years ago. </p>
<p>Regardless of this fact, every once in awhile someone who I work with will say, &quot;You got a haircut.&quot; They don't say, &quot;Did you get your haircut?&quot; They say it like &quot;You [finally] got a haircut.&quot; As if I don't get one every single friday. The weirdest part about it is it's not on Friday when my head is still moist from the morning dew. They'll say it on a Wednesday afternoon, a mere five plus days after my haircut.</p>
