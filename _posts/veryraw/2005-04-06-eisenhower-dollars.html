      Man, we thought it was just our dad.  When I used to work at Pathmark, he would come through my line (before they stopped family from being in my line) and pay with all $2 bills.  I would have to put them over with the checks and that stuff b/c there is no slot for them.
      
      Benn mainly goes for the $2 bills and the Sacagawea (sp?) dollars, but I bet he would take the other stuff too.  Geoff, want to point him towards more less-circulated currency?

    content: "A tale of customer service, justice and currency as funny as a $2 bill\r\n\
      \r\n\
      PUT YOURSELF in Mike Bolesta's place. On the morning of Feb. 20, he buys a new radio-CD player for his 17-year-old son Christopher's car. He pays the $114 installation charge with 57 crisp new $2 bills, which, when last observed, were still considered legitimate currency in the United States proper. The $2 bills are Bolesta's idea of payment, and his little comic protest, too.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      For this, Bolesta, Baltimore County resident, innocent citizen, owner of Capital City Student Tours, finds himself under arrest.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Finds himself, in front of a store full of customers at the Best Buy on York Road in Lutherville, locked into handcuffs and leg irons.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Finds himself transported to the Baltimore County lockup in Cockeysville, where he's handcuffed to a pole for three hours while the U.S. Secret Service is called into the case.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Have a nice day, Mike.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      \"Humiliating,\" the 57-year old Bolesta was saying now. \"I am 6 feet 5 inches tall, and I felt like 8 inches high. To be handcuffed, to have all those people looking on, to be cuffed to a pole -- and to know you haven't done anything wrong. And me, with a brother, Joe, who spent 33 years on the city police force. It was humiliating.\"\r\n\
      \r\n\
      What we have here, besides humiliation, is a sense of caution resulting in screw-ups all around.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      \"When I bought the stereo player,\" Bolesta explains, \"the technician said it'd fit perfectly into my son's dashboard. But it didn't. So they called back and said they had another model that would fit perfectly, and it was cheaper. We got a $67 refund, which was fine. As long as it fit, that's all.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      \"So we go back and pay for it, and they tell us to go around front with our receipt and pick up the difference in the cost. I ask about installation charges. They said, 'No installation charge, because of the mix-up. Our mistake, no charge.' Swell.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      \"But then, the next day, I get a call at home. They're telling me, 'If you don't come in and pay the installation fee, we're calling the police.' Jeez, where did we go from them admitting a mistake to suddenly calling the police? So I say, 'Fine, I'll be in tomorrow.' But, overnight, I'm starting to steam a little. It's not the money -- it's the threat. So I thought, I'll count out a few $2 bills.\"\r\n\
      \r\n\
      He has lots and lots of them.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      With his Capital City Student Tours, he arranges class trips for school kids around the country traveling to large East Coast cities, including Baltimore. He's been doing this for the last 18 years. He makes all the arrangements: hotels, meals, entertainment. And it's part of his schtick that, when Bolesta hands out meal money to students, he does it in $2 bills, which he picks up from his regular bank, Sun Trust.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      \"The kids don't see that many $2 bills, so they think this is the greatest thing in the world,\" Bolesta says. \"They don't want to spend 'em. They want to save 'em. I've been doing this since I started the company. So I'm thinking, 'I'll stage my little comic protest. I'll pay the $114 with $2 bills.'\"\r\n\
      \r\n\
      At Best Buy, they may have perceived the protest -- but did not sense the comic aspect of 57 $2 bills.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      \"I'm just here to pay the bill,\" Bolesta says he told a cashier. \"She looked at the $2 bills and told me, 'I don't have to take \r\n\
      \r\n\
      these if I don't want to.' I said, 'If you don't, I'm leaving. I've tried to pay my bill twice. You don't want these bills, you can sue me.' So she took the money. Like she's doing me a favor.\"\r\n\
      \r\n\
      He remembers the cashier marking each bill with a pen. Then other store personnel began to gather, a few of them asking, \"Are these real?\"\r\n\
      \r\n\
      \"Of course they are,\" Bolesta said. \"They're legal tender.\"\r\n\
      \r\n\
      A Best Buy manager refused comment last week. But, according to a Baltimore County police arrest report, suspicions were roused when an employee noticed some smearing of ink. So the cops were called in. One officer noticed the bills ran in sequential order.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      \"I told them, 'I'm a tour operator. I've got thousands of these bills. I get them from my bank. You got a problem, call the bank,'\" Bolesta says. \"I'm sitting there in a chair. The store's full of people watching this. All of a sudden, he's standing me up and handcuffing me behind my back, telling me, 'We have to do this until we get it straightened out.'\r\n\
      \r\n\
      \"Meanwhile, everybody's looking at me. I've lived here 18 years. I'm hoping my kids don't walk in and see this. And I'm saying, 'I can't believe you're doing this. I'm paying with legal American money.'\"\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Bolesta was then taken to the county police lockup in Cockeysville, where he sat handcuffed to a pole and in leg irons while the Secret Service was called in.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      \"At this point,\" he says, \"I'm a mass murderer.\"\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Finally, Secret Service agent Leigh Turner arrived, examined the bills and said they were legitimate, adding, according to the police report, \"Sometimes ink on money can smear.\"\r\n\
      \r\n\
      This will be important news to all concerned.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      For Baltimore County police, said spokesman Bill Toohey, \"It's a sign that we're all a little nervous in the post-9/11 world.\"\r\n\
      \r\n\
      The other day, one of Bolesta's sons needed a few bucks. Bolesta pulled out his wallet and \"whipped out a couple of $2 bills. But my son turned away. He said he doesn't want 'em any more.\"\r\n\
      \r\n\
      He's seen where such money can lead. "

    content: Haha, That's great.  Someone tried to use one of those down here (puerto rico) the other day and only me and the kid that was trying to use it believed that it was legal tender.  $2 bills... classic.

I use Commerce Bank.  They make it as far north as West Chester, New York.  A bit of a drive.  I bet if you ask when you are at the bank that they have some.  It all depends on what they get in their money shipments and I'm sure they can ask.  I bet that someone had deposited them recently at my bank.  Maybe if you ask them to get them they can get them.

      Man, I hope that Mike guy sues both Best Buy and the Baltimore County police...that's one case that needs national media attention so that people will actually learn something.
      
      Next time I'm in his area, I'm going to Best Buy with $2 bills jsut to spite them for him.

<p>I stopped at the bank yesterday to deposit some loot and saw that the teller had some Eisenhower dollars behind the counter.</p>
<blockquote><em>Tim:</em> May I buy some of those Eisenhower dollars?<br />
<em>Teller:</em> Sure how many do you want?<br />
<em>Tim:</em> How many your got? (I question as if I'm some high roller by insinuating that I'd buy all that they have there.)<br />
<em>Teller:</em> 225. (she states smuggly)<br />
<em>Tim:</em> (defeated) I'll take five.</blockquote>
<p>I don't collect these things.  I have several in a collection of many other coins, US and international, but I didn't buy these to add to the collection. I got them so I could use them.</p>
<p>My father often asks for Eisenhower dollars, Sacagawea Golden Dollars, Susan B. Anthony dollars, JFK fifty cents pieces and two dollar bills  when he's at the bank for the same reason.  It's fun to use them if for no other reason than to see people's reactions.</p>
