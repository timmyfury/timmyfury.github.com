      well  let me just say that cosmo from farily odd parent,s is a creep,
      he give,s me nightmares,
      i feel like running away from him alot,
      and i think wanda is right about him,
      he is a idot,
      timmy get,s influinced by cosmo,s evil plot,s
      they play silly games,
      drives wanda crazy, all the time,
      and then you know why he,s like that,
      he filrt,s with other women,
      he lie,s  he is not honest,
      i think he is  a nightmare  to me
      so i,m telling you all to lookout for cosmo
      because he is evil, and he will do evil stuff,
      put you under his spell,
      so watch out, and stay  safe,

<p>So I was walking around my house tonight making suction cup noises with my mouth as I walked. I thought it was really funny. I mean imagine if I had suction   cups on my feet. It would obviously rule. You could totally walk up walls and   pick things up without bending over. I mean some people can already do this   but I mean you could do it without being called awful names like "Crazy Long toe McGee" or "Finger Foot". </p>
<p>Then this made me think back to the good old days. Back when my house was rockin' an <a href="http://members.chello.at/theodor.lauppert/computer/ps2/9556.htm">IBM   PS/2 486</a>. Man did we rule. We bought this shareware game, called "<a href="http://www.3drealms.com/cosmo/">Cosmo's Cosmic Adventures.</a>" Circa March 1992. I loved that game. In fact I loved it so much that I still have it. It originally came on one 3.5" floppy and took like 3 minutes to load. That was on <a href="http://www.logicalsky.com/Windows31_FAQ.htm">windows3.1</a>. Now I have moved up in the world and I have me this fancy pentium2.3ghz with close to a gig of RAM driving around with a full load of software on Windows XP Pro. Only took me three days to install on this machine and close to 25 minutes to get the damn thing running but man is this sweet.</p>
<p>Look at this guy. It would rule. You could drink as much as you want and never drop your glass. You could climb buildings and shit. You would rule the window   washing business. I do suppose there would be downfalls though. There's no way in hell you could manage driving without some sort of special apparatus. Changing   your spark plugs may be difficult. Certainly you would have extreme trouble with your girlfriend's extra-curriculars. Although I suppose it would make a <a href="http://www.cloudforest-mexico.org/183.htm">serious penis enlargement system</a>. It could also make a great portable cereal bowl. But not at the   same time I suppose.</p>
<p>To sum up what I am trying to say, giant suction cups have benefits and fallbacks just like hands do.</p>
<p>On a completely seperate note, Like two years ago when I did a search for Cosmo there was nothing. Now there is like a damned <a href="http://www.rds-celle.de/cosmofansite/">fan club</a>("Please notice: My English is not perfect and this site is a project in its early state. There might be a lot of mistakes or broken links."). There are <a href="http://home.online.no/%7Ep-olstad/apogee/cosmo.html">extra levels</a> now. There are <a href="http://www.student.tue.nl/u/a.f.smeijers/sfp/fram/cosmo.htm">cheat codes</a>.You should seriously go to the <a href="http://www.3drealms.com/cosmo/">Cosmo site</a> and download the shareware vesion of the game. Here's a <a href="http://personalwebs.oakland.edu/%7Elcmatero/cosmo/">synopsis of the game</a>(I stole that picture from this guy). In <a href="http://www.masagames.f2s.com/cheats/cosmo.php">Russian</a>.<a href="http://cheaty.idnes.cz/c/cosmoscosmicadventure.html">Czech</a>.<a href="http://www.lexigame.de/de/system/cosmo.htm">German</a>.<a href="http://www.portan.co.il/oldies4ever/game1.asp?code=470">Arabic</a>.<a href="http://digilander.libero.it/pccheats/cosmoscosmicadventure.html">Italian</a>.<a href="http://www.gamersnet.nl/cheats/cheat.php3?id=565">Dutch</a>.<a href="http://www.ddj.com.br/dicas/dicas.php?jogo=891">Brazilian</a>. Everybody loves Cosmo. Okay I'm done.</p>
