    content: I am a big fan of the <a href="http://www.oralb.com/products/product.asp?tid=products&amp;sub=manual&amp;cid=manual&amp;pid=crossaction" rel="nofollow">Oral-B Cross Action</a>. It feels like its scraping the filth from my teeth and using its angle to get further into the tooth crevices.

<p>I was brushing my teeth the other day.  I had noticed that the bristles were a bit worn and it should probably be replaced, but I waited.  I waited too long.  In the middle of brushing my teeth, every bristle in the brush fell out of the tooth brush in my mouth leaving behind a bare handle.  It was bizarre, terrifying even.  It's like driving down the road and the steering wheel falling off in your hands.</p>
<p>I looked in the linen closet and there was luckily an unused toothbrush there. It was "soft".  The handle was flexible like a bendy straw.  When I had finished brushing, my mouth felt no cleaner than before.  It was weird.  Don't even know why I bothered.  I had to go out and buy another one of my trusty "medium" brushes.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000C4KJK/sr=1-5/qid=1127224730/ref=sr_1_5/102-1302376-3181759">the Oral B Advantage</a>.  I have been using it for years.  I have bought several different types of brushes as my secondary (for travel or campin) and nothing holds up quite like it.  </p>
