<p>I had this chicken sandwich from Burger King today.  I was burping all day after I ate it.  The burps tasted like whopper burps.  So here's my theory... the flame broiled smell you smell when you drive past a Burger King isn't a grill.  It's actually the smell of the exhaust of a machine that takes a mass of BK by-product and molds it into the shape of the food you order.  I bet its true cause everything at Burger King gives you that same taste in your burps.</p>
