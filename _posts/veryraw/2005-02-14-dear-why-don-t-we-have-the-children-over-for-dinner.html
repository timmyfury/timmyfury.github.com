    content: Dude, I broke down and got on the delicious bandwagon today. Holy shit, it's sweet. Then I found the <a href="http://dietrich.ganx4.com/foxylicious/">Foxylicious</a> FF extension. Now I can have my delicious links imported into a folder in my FF bookmarks automagically daily at both home and work! So now, no more bookmarking of pages in the browser, just add them suckers to delicious and let it do the work for me. SWEET! And thanks for the link to the WP plugin to display your delicious links in WP, will get on that one soon.

<p>I am attempting to set up a script that will pull my last 10 <a href="http://del.icio.us/timmyfury">del.icio.us</a> links and drop them into a list on the side so you always get my freshest links (that's ill).  The <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=getting+delicious+feed">search that I performed</a> gave me some really good leads to what I am actually looking for.  It also gave me a site that is slightly disturbing...</p>

<p><img src="http://veryraw.com/images/large/babyfood2.jpg" alt="disturbing results" /></p>

<p>I have said it a million times.  I do not care for children.  I know I work at a science museum. I know my job is with children.  Dealing with children as a large group is very different than dealing with children one on one.  I'm not so good with the later.  The former I excel at because I've learn that dealing with large groups of children is like dealing with a very large herd of sheep.  You push a few in a general direction and the rest will usually follow.  Then when all else fails if you talk really loudly and make broad gestures, they will try to get away from you.  Works well in my job because the parents think that you are really good with children when you are actually just really terrifying.</p>

<p>My point is, if I may go as far as to say I have one, I was not searching for recipes for children.  Although this site leads me to believe that there is a book out there that provides you with that variety of information. I was going to quote parts of the page for you to prove it.  It's just better if you <a href="http://www.healthy-baby-food.com/baby_recipe.htm">go there yourself</a>.</p>
