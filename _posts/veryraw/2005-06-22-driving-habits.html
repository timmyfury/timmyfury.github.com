	Of all the things people have told me I am incorrigible is the most frequently used.  If I had a dollar for every time I was told that I am incorrigible I would probably have about 100 dollars.  Not only is it the most frequently used word by people when they are regaling me with their unwelcome and unnecessary evaluations of my personality, but it is my personal favorite.
	Webster dictionary defines incorrigible as â€œNot corrigible; incapable of being corrected or amended; bad beyond correction; irreclaimable; as, incorrigible error.â€  Yes, thatâ€™s me.  There probably isnâ€™t a single word in the English language that better describes me as this word.  
	Other words that have been used to describe my behavior include immature, hardheaded, and unreasonable.  These donâ€™t apply to my personality as well as incorrigible does.  Immature is when you arenâ€™t grown up enough to understand what you are doing wrong.  Hardheaded is a good adjective to use when you are describing someone who wonâ€™t admit they are wrong or someone that always thinks that their idea is the best.  Lastly, unreasonable doesnâ€™t apply to me because unreasonable implies that someone is irrational.  I am irrational at times, but in general, I react in a mature manner to things.
	I have a tendency to refuse other peopleâ€™s advice or concerns.  I donâ€™t accept that what they have been through could ever apply to what I am saying, thinking or doing.  I insist on learning everything the hard way.  No one knows best but me.  
	My most famous incorrigible behavior is my driving.  I love to drive.  I will always be the driver.  No matter how many cars are around, I am always driving.  Furthermore, I love to drive fast and reckless.  There is nothing more exhilarating to me then driving two, sometimes three times the speed limit.  The tighter I cut a corner or the closer I come to hitting the cars in front or behind me while I change lanes, the more fun I have.  
	I got my license when I was 19 years old.  Sixteen months later the state took my license away for 2 years.  In those sixteen months I was pulled over fifty-five times.  I received eight major speeding violations, one violation for running a red light, one reckless endangerment, one inattentive driving and countless non-point citations.  I was pulled over in five different states and every county in southeastern Pennsylvania.  At the beginning of my suspension there were 24 points on my license.  
	In September of 2002 my license was returned.  Since then I have been pulled over seven times and received one ticket, which carries four points and a hearing.  In addition I have been in five accidents.  Only one of those accidents wasnâ€™t my fault.  
	Over the course of my time with a license I have been told by countless people to slow down and drive more safely.  I may never learn.  Incorrigible is the most admirable of all the childish behaviors because it shows tenacity, consistency and a lack of gall toward the people who try to change your habits.  These three things make an incorrigible person more tolerable then someone with the other qualities above because you can count on this quality to always be there.
