    content: those pictures are cave crickets, my parents have them in their basement. The only reason i know is that i was watching a nature show on pbs and spotted them. They jump goddamn high and bite pretty nastily as well.

      Tim,
      
      You are lucky to have a father with such an active desire to step out of the box.  I hope you appricate that.  I would also spend time perfecting your already supurb writing skills as I see a Crowe family book in the future.  All I want is a small page for the picture of my home grown Crowe decoder ring (patent pending).

      Hi,
      I just stumbled across this page while I was looking for a way to kill said posted crickets. They are variously called Spider Crickets, Camelback Crickets or Cave Crickets. I have developed a phobia of them. I am learning to be able to squish them at a distance without freaking out. Basically they live in crawl spaces and basements and can live off mold. So I would go to google and type in "spider crickets". As far as I have been able to tell, they actually don't bite. But they will jump at you and have chitinous feet. ick... Ok, I am creeping myself out now. Good luck.

      I don't think they are that bad.  They are there because they serve a purpose.  That was the first one that we had ever seen in my basement so either they are new or the regular black crickets have eaten them every year thus far and this one just happen to make the cut for the year. "

      well, they've seem to have migrated to Virginia,
      they are all over my parents shed.
      
      i've had a fear of them FOREVER.
      
      i started calling them spider crickets on my own, because i used to think they were spiders until they jumped.
      i usually find them in the bathtub, or i'll be asleep and then i'll hear them when they land on something hard. freaks me out.

      While in normal circumstances I would not be afraid of these camel crickets, my experience with them throughout my childhood has provided me with my one phobia.  Now that i am back in the house of my childhood and need to use the basement often, I need to control these creatures.  
      How do I do it.  They have not only made it to the first floor but also to the bathroom on the second floor.  Of course the floors of most rooms in my house are dark brown.  So who knows how many exist.
      It seems from previous entries that spraying insectisides do not work well.
      What should I do? something, before I start having nightmares about them crawling into my mouth.

      I had one in my new apartment the other day.  I saw it jump across my peripheral vision.  I turned to look behind me and caught a glimpse of it jump again.  It landed on my desk chair (where I was sitting).  I grabbed a tissue from my desk and as I reached to squash the scariest bug in the world it jumped onto my hand.  Terrifying.  I shook it to the ground and squashed it by foot there.  All the while avoiding telling Trish to prevent her from buying pesticides.  
      
      I don't know if there is a way to get rid of them.  I would suppose that ridding your house of dark cool places to hide would be the best bet.  If they have nothing to hide behind they will probably steer clear.

It not only took out most of the bugs and crickets in our house but also anthing smaller than a german shephard in the neighborhood.  No squirrels, moles or birds for a couple months after that cat died.  And it's only recently that our Dad has started finding the crickets in the basement again.

      Miss Jones, Don't worry about the errors.  I'm not particularly afraid of them myself, except when they are jumping around and I'm trying to catch them and they land on me.  I totally freak out.  I only have my father's ability to touch bugs without getting the willies to an extent.  There's just something about them that makes me squirm. 
      
      As for what to do, I have been researching a bit and I am working on a follow up to this article.  It seems as if there has been a rush of them recently.  The amount of hits this site has gotten from google searches for these things is amazing.  Seems like alot of people are interested in the topic so I'll do some digging.  Until then hang in there.  Winter will come and those little bastards will freeze their asses off.

I would also like to think my immune system is nothing like a bugs system and I would only hope it would kill a bug as that is what is made to do.  Although raid is most definetly not healthy, you can spray the perimeter of the infected area and open up the windows or leave the house for a while so as not to breathe it in. I'll pass on spritzing it in my face but thanks for being so very kind about it.

    content: I know. I mean no insult, I am just very anti-pesticide.  Cave crickets aren't indoor breeders though.  Spraying the area that you see them in is not very effective because they are generally solitary and only wander into your house by accident.  Everything I have read to date on them suggests that you eliminate cool dark areas.  <a href="http://www.ipm.iastate.edu/ipm/iiin/ccamelcr.html" rel="nofollow">Eliminating hiding and breeding places</a> around your house and moreover in your yard will help to prevent them from sneaking into your house.

      We've had camelback crickets for about 15 years. It's a good bet they are breeding in a woodpile that's too near our house.
      But I don't have another place to put the woodpile.  Some of these buggers get in the house. In particular they come inside in the fall.  I've applied Sevin dust around the woodpile (it's in a shelter and does not get wet). Also, I go out at night and kill individual crickets with Raid or something similar. This keeps the population down. 
      
      On another site I just noticed two more ideas. (1) Use glue boards inside the house in dark cave-like places. Glue boards are just cardboard with a very sticky glue. This should get rid of individual crickets that stray into the house. (2) Sprinkle Borax dust near where they are breeding. Good idea!!! This is a little known idea. Borax dust kills cockroaches and a lot of other pests. As some have said, "it cuts the bugs like glass cuts humans". It really does. They lose fluids through the cuts and dehydrate and die. I'm going to apply Borax powder right after I finish this note. I've used it for other pests, and feel sort of stupid because I didn't think of it sooner.
      
      A by-the-way... you can make ant poison (sweet eating ants only) by blending Borax powder into Karo syrup. Add Borax and stir and do this until the mixture is saturated. Borax is CHEAP... a lot cheaper than the usual pesticides.

    content: I too came across this site while chatting with friends and I just would like to say that NORTH CAROLINA has these spider, cave, or camel crickets. I ABSOULUTELY hate these things. One got into my house one day and I no other choice but to kill it. I didn't know what it was, but it reminded me of those people from that alien movie Charlie Sheen was in with the bent legs. I am Sooooooo freaked out by these and my fiance' knows that. So the other night after I got in bed he says to me, " Oh my God I know I didn't hear one of those spider crickets things". Before I could even think clear he dropped a rolled up rubber band on top of me.. Needless to say I came out swinging turned on the light and realized he was just BSing with me..I was so mad at him because my fear or maybe borderline phobia is so intense. It was cool reading the post b/c now I know we aren't the only ones being terrorized!!!

      We live in Cincinnati and have lots of camel crickets in our basement &amp; garage which is part of our basement.  I just did a web search using "crickets in basement" and found lots of good web sites.
      
      The web sites all say that they don't bite, but one site does say that they actually jump toward you - not away.  That has happened to me many times and really freaks me out.  Whacking them with a broom makes it so that they cannot jump at you.
      
      Having a dehumidifier in our garage seems to help. I think we need to seal more areas around windows and our garage door.  I am going to try to figure out how to keep our basement as dry as possible and make it less "cave-like".  Also, since I can't stand them, I am just going to stay out of our basement at night if I can help it - they seem worse then.

      i read, that once a female cricket finds her way into the house, they lay 100 of eggs. and lately every evening my husband and me find like 2 or 3 at least (per evening), we only see them evenins/nights. i vacuum them with the long vacuum stick, don't know how you call those, anyway, it's not easy catching them, cause they jump, but sooner or later, i get them, i have a good distance from them, cause i have the long vacuum stick between us, hope it stays like that and they don't jump on me. it freeks me out, if i think, i won't get rid of them. is there a good way to get rid of them without using poison, will they dissapear in the winter (even in california, where the winter isn't as cold as in other states)? i am pregnant, i am scared letting my baby playing on the floor, do they really jump on people or rather jump away from people. are there different kinds of crickets, i don't know what kind of crickets we have, but they look like the picture above.\r\n\

    content: I have spider crickets all over my basement.  I just killed one last night (with spray).  It must have jumped 20 feet with the initial spray.  I spray and run!  I'm terrified of these things.  The first time I ever saw them was last year.  My basement was infested with them.  This year we had regular crickets and now I just saw my first spider cricket of the year last night.  We always think they're spiders!  Last year when I saw my first one I swore the spiders and crickets were mating!  That's why I call them spider crickets.  It's nice to know that others have them.  Misery loves company you know?  Now, does anyone know how to keep them out of my basement?

    content: "On October 3 I posted a message concerning our camelback cricket problem.  All experts say the trick is to kill them outside the house. Apparently the ones that come inside just wander in through cracks. Kill them outside the the problem is gone.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      So we sprinkled Borax (Boric Acid) powder around our woodpile.\r\n\
      That's where they seem to be hatching. It's under a shelter, dry, and near the house. Borax (sold as a roach killer) will kill most crawling insects.  I bought a large container of Borax (advertised as a roach killer) at a dollar store for $2.00 and sprinkled it generously around the woodpile in a band about 12 inches wide.  Then I sprinkled some flakes of dry oatmeal on top of the Borax to give the buggers something to eat and a reason to walk in the Borax. Contact with the Borax kills them... they do not have to eat it. There are now dead camelback crickets around the woodpile. I check every night after dark and the live cricket count is zero.  Before doing this treatment those critters were having a party out there every night.  We've had no camelbacks in our home for about three weeks. None!!\r\n\
      \r\n\
      After 15 years of putting up with these things we seem to have a solution. And it's a cheap solution, too.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Of course if you put the Borax in places were it will be wet from rain, this may not work at all.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Another thing we did was to sprinkle Borax on the threshold of basement doors that we seldom open. We have been convinced this is the place they have been coming inside.  There are now dead sowbugs and other dead creepy-crawly things on the thresholds along with the corpses of a few camelback crickets.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      This turned out to be easier than we thought. We've used Borax (Boric Acid) to kill roaches but until recently never thought about using it to kill camelback crickets.\r\n "

      I have seen this cricket spider in my apartment and it has caused me much grief/fear.  I called for an exterminator who said it was a cricket but I didn't believer her until I found your website.  My fear was being bitten by what I thought was a spider.  I'm recovering from blood poisoning and don't want to get bitten but something like that.  Knowing that it is only a cricket brings some relief.  If, in fact, it does not bite.  I'm going to get some borax and sprinkle it outside my apartment patio and windows.

    content: My first encounter with these uber-vile creatures was when I was 9.  I could not breathe, move, speak, or swallow.  My mother found me outside in our storage room close to shock.  They covered the walls and the deep freezer!! I was just going out there to the freezer to get a popsicle and that's what I found.  I am now 34, newly married (to an entymologist's son, naturally) and am as horrified of them as I was at 9.  They bring out something in me that I don't understand.  My fear of these beasties is way beyond my comprehension.  They are the devil.  They used to lurk in our basement where they washer/dryer are, you could hear them jumping around when you opened the door.  Before we married I told my husband that I would not live in this house unless they were completely eradicated.  Now the pest control co. comes every other Friday and treat the outside of the house.  That has done away with them (except for the one the size of a small Volkswagen I saw outside last weekend) and I can breathe easy - sort of.  I still do a quick search of all walls, ceilings, and floors before I walk into a room, and forget abt walking anywhere barefoot or without all the lights on.  I was so glad to find this site and hear of others like me.  I thought I was crazy!  They are entirely too aggressive, there is no need for them to jump all at your face and whatnot when you're just trying to destroy them!!

    content: This is our first year with Camel/Cave Cricket, they spook the begesus out of me. We usually get the regular crickets when the fall is particularly damp, but these things UGH. Even my cats won't go after them, and they're usually pretty good bug catchers. A friend of mine who has an exterminator come to her house was told they don't bite, but they jump toward you when startled as a defensive reaction (I guess that makes sense, who/what would expect it to jump toward the attacker??)We find them mainly around our house, but they are known to hitchhike into the house on pants legs. We have Wolf spiders too and in dim lighting they're hard to tell apart, I'm not sure which is worse. On a side note, I am not big on bug spray, except when it comes to BIG spiders, then I spray and clean up the carcass so my cats don't eat it.

      My friend in Virginia has them in her laundry room like crazy.
      The laundry room is a utility room that is a few steps down from the house and has a crawl space under the house beside it.
      
      Her 19 year old cat's box is in there, too. When the cat misses the box, the scary crickets eat it. Really.  She has witnessed it.  THe poo will be covered in the crickets, or as she calls them, hoppies.  In the morning, the poop is gone from the floor and the crickets have gone back into the crawl space.  I went in there once at night and was completely freaked out.  I didn't know about the crickets.
      I live in Florida and live with the giant roaches.

    content: I live in Virginia and have had spider crickets for about three years...one just appeared one day and have been living here ever since.  I have three daughters and we are all terrified by these enormous beasts.  They have recently become more brazen and are hopping up from the basement (it's finished, but we're all too scared to spend any time down there) into my kitchen and family room.  I have watched them just hop right on up! Needless to say, there is a lot of screaming, broom smashing, and raid spraying.  Ok, so we have an exterminator, but we still have the critters...he says that we'll never be able to completely eradicate them.  I'm thinking he's overpaid and not doing his job.  So, Angela, what is your exterminator using???  I need to get some of whatever it is!  Also, did you know that MICE are attracted by them?  The only good thing about having mice around was the fact that we hardly had any crickets for awhile!  In fact, my kids begged me not to set traps for the mice.  If my one daughters wasn't allergic I'd get a cat...ahhhh...the circle of life!

      I cannot believe I found a blog site on Camelback Crickets. We have them in the crawl space of our house, here in North Carolina. They often find their way into our bathroom and we have yet to figure out how they are getting in. 
      My husband and son affectionately call them "Jumpies" and we see both big and small. They are definitely the ugliest, creepiest bug I have ever encountered. They will jump toward you, and I have had one chase me out of my kitchen (or atleast it felt like it was chasing me). From what I have read in my internet search on these bugs, they will eat ANYTHING, including mold and FABRIC, any kind of man made fabric like rugs, drapes, CLOTHES, etc. 
      I would love to spray or exterminate around my house and in the crawl space, however, there are a lot of domestic cats and a few dogs that live around us and I have two cats of my own, and I'm afraid of putting any kind of pesticide or even borax out for fear of exposing the animals to it. We've been living with these creatures for about 13 years now. I absolutely HATE them.

      I have recently discovered them in our crawl space here in Winfield, West Virginia. Have only seen one or two tops in many years past but, now for the past couple of months they have been finding their way into our family room via a heat vent in the floor. They have obviously found their way into the duct work on that side of the house. The one vent is the only place they have shown themselves (so far). I plan to set off a *bug-bomb* in the crawl space (probably sometime today) and wait for the results. Our crawl space is fairly well sealed off from the outside. There's obviously a breech somewhere and I plan to find it. Maybe in one of the vent screens, I suspect.
      I'm amazed they're as active as they are in these fairly extreme cold temps we have been experiencing; especially this past month. Apparently they're not just a *spring* &amp; *summer* creature. They can survive the harsh cold to some extent.

Other than being a "new" bug we had never seen before we did not make too much of it. However, over the last several months, we have killed about a dozen of them.  I have had much success using diatamacious earth to get rid of earwigs. I wonder if that will work with cave crickets. ANybody had any lucK. Ooohhh and how do those things stay alive during the winter, we've already had plenty of cold and some snow...Thanks

They were more prevalent at night.  The earlier ones make crackly noises as they hit things jumping.   Also, had my brother let off 2 bug bombs in the basement for me.

My options were: freak out or relax. I chose the latter. Now they don't bother me so much. We get along. I am still going to Borax the hell out of the crawl space though.

      I LOVE Tim's sense of humor...but I HATE those things.  I discovered them in the '60s (I'm not THAT old, am I?), and have ALWAYS had a fear of them...mainly because, when you try to get them, they jump AT you, not away!  That, coupled with NO ONE has EVER seen them (except the few and the proud (and I don't mean my Marine Corps brethern either)!  So they're an honest to goodness cricket, huh?  (My 6 year old daughter scared the fool out of me last night...blood curdling scream when we came home.  I thought for sure someone was holding a knife to her.  I went running into her room, just to find her cowering from one of them.  My room is (may sound familiar to another post, but isn't same family) in the basement, next to the laundry room.  I have to get rid of them too...sorry Tim.  I'll be sure to take a spritz in the face for you though! (LOL))

    content: I guess when they say " It's a small world" they are right. I used to live in Memphis Tn and I have a huge phobia of spiders. I have childhood memories of these things chasing me and my cousins out of the room. Now I live here in Mississippi and I've started seeing thing in friends homes. Funnily enough we have none.. though it may be due to our three dogs and eight cats! ( GO Animal Power! Lol) Altough we dotn have them here I do dread going to visit releatives in Memphis who have them every where. I think these things are rejects of sort and must not be too tasty. I say this due to the fact my younger cousion once set about trying to feed a few to his pet lizards. Weeks went by and the crickets remained at one end of the cage and the lizards seemed to be rooted to the other in fear. When I heard about the Borax treat ment I hastily set about treatign my home and have yet to see any . At first I kept watch on my animals in fear of them getting sick fromt he poison . Now I dont worry as they seem to pretty much stay away from it . Later on I plan on getting my dad to take care of the massive crawl space under the house just to be safe.  On another note I think it's time we make a group O.F.A.S.C " Online Friends Against Spider Crikets" .. just an idea mind you .

      I have just noticed these last summer (2005)  I live on Long Island in NY and I had never seen them before last summer and I am terrified of them.  I too called them spider crickets cause they look like a spider and jump like a cricket.  I am terrified of crickets, so these just creep me out.
      I decided to do a search on them and found this site and am glad to see that I am not alone in the fear of them.
      Thank goodness they are mostly in my basement, but once in a while they like to come upstairs and scare the heck out of me.
      I have a bearded dragon who eats crickets, but these spider crickets are too fast for her.

      I had the same problem as many, dozens and dozens of camelback crickets in crawlspace, home and garage until a friend gave me this potion.  Have been cricket free for over a year.  Main ingredient is boric acid mixed with some food for bait and bacon grease to hold it together.
      
      8 oz. boric acid
      1/2 c. flour
      1 c. sugar
      1 small onion
      1/4 c. bacon drippings
      a few drops of water
      
      Mix flour and boric acid and stir in chopped onion.  Blend into creamed (cool) bacon grease and sugar.  Add enough water drops to form soft dough and shape into small balls.  Place balls on plastic coffee can lids, aluminum foil or discarded saucers.  I was warned the mixture eats through waxed paper and can leave a greasy residue behind if placed directly on floor.  If mixture gets too thin, spoon it onto container, it will work.  Place toxic balls in problem areas; basement, crawl space, garage... Remember to keep away from pets or children!  My batch is over a year old and is still working.  I was told if they come back, it's time to make a new mixture.
      
      If it works for you, pass it on!

    content: I have just LAUGHED so hard!!   I seriously thought I was the only person in the world that had what I called "The Jumping Spider" phobia.   We live in an old house with a basement in Mooresville, NC and they are everywhere!!  The big ones scare me and the little millions of babies are just as creepy!!  I still can't get over that I am not the only one.  I am so glad there is a blog out here for me and I'm not alone.  I need to kill those crazy bastards!

    content: I have these crickets in my apartment. They are always in the bathroom. The bathroom is dark. Do you think that it would help to open the blinds, let natural light in. I want to try the borax, but can you put this inside the house?

    content: I have them in my basement as well.  actually, i had just walked down to the basement to do some laundry, one of those thingamajigs tried to attack me.  i throw the first thing i could find at hands reach, a dust pan, and it jumped where i could not see it.  i came up stairs to tell my fiance about it, and thats why i find this website.  because he swore it was a cricket, and i swore it was a spider.  therefore i decided to bet him.  i was so convinded it was a spider, $1,000 seemed appropriate.  he wasn't as positive so we settled for $20.  can i still say it is a "jumping spider."   by the way did i say that i am absolutely terrified of them.  how do i kill em without killing my dogs.

    content: my sister and i called them hybrids for the longest time. we are both terrified of them. we're in wichita, ks and lawrence, ks. i had one in my shower one day and tried throwing things at it in hopes that it would jump out, but no such luck, i had to shower upstairs that day. i also had one in my sink one time that i managed to drown, at least i assume, it went down the drain at least. i hate these things more then anything else. spiders i can handle, crickets i can handle, but whatever these things are make me sick to my stomach, i literally can't eat anything for awhile after i see one. my boyfriend used to think i was crazy till i got up enough nerve to catch one one day and take it over to his house for him to see.  god i hate spider crickets, thanks for letting me share my stories. i'm going to get some borax and call my sister and tell her to also. thanks!

    content: Those things have infested our house in Nc too.  Both my brothers have been bitten by them.  We havent tried any poison yet but will give the borax a shot.  I used to just see them in drainage ditches but they have migrated to the house.  Mild winters arent helping either.  Much luck to everyone with those sonsofbitches.

    content: hey...we are really bad infested with "spider crickets" in TN.but after going to a website on "boxelder bugs" we found a trick to get rid of them...It really works...the little bastards quit jumping about 10-15 seconds after getting sprayed...We thought it might work so we tried it...Go to the store and buy some WASP &amp; HORNET SPRAY. It sprays up to 20 feet when brand new so you don't have to get too close to them...Try it, it really works

      I am living in fear I was already terrified of spiders 
      these creatures are very intelligent they will not move 
      until you get close and then they jump at you I walk around my house with a can of raid.

    content: I've been moving some furniture out of a house in Texas and have had many encounters with these creepy crawlers.  One found its way into the new house.  I'm not afraid of spiders, crickets, scorpions, etc., but I can't even look at these things without wimpering like a baby. I feel as though I was bit by one at a younger age, but i'm not sure if I just imagined it. There needs to be a phobia devoted to camel crickets. I'm sure others would agree.

<p>When my parents bought their house 30+ years ago they had a bug problem.  Roaches and water bugs wandered all over the place at night.  My mother wanted to spray insect poison around the house but my father asked to have a healthy shot at it first.  He went down to the field down the street and caught crickets, white spiders and something that we have called lions for as long as I can remember<a href="#footnote">*</a>.</p>

<p>The problem was solved.  This trio of bugs killed every other bug in the house.  When there was nothing else too eat they ate each other.  These canabalistic bastards helped my parents avoid  <a href="http://www.halfgiraffe.com/oldlady.html">The Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly</a> from being played out in my basement by controlling their own population.</p>

<p>Now, every spring they reproduce based on the supply of bugs which creep into the house.  When the supply dies down they control again.  It has worked very well for 30 years and we have never had to use pesticides in my house.</p>

<p>All is well right?  Until about a week ago when I father caught this terrifying little creature.  It jumped almost across the basement before it jumped into my father.  He caught it.  I photographed it.  It seems that the crickets and white spiders have mated.</p>

<p id="footnote"><strong>Footnote:</strong> I don't think that they are actually called lions.  They range from very tiny to nearly two inches long.  They look like they could be from the centipede family due to their googol legs, but their legs are long and look fuzzy.  Maybe I will catch a picture of them one day and you can help me identify them.</p>
