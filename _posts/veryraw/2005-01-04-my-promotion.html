<p>So a few days ago I told you about <a href="http://veryraw.com/history/2004/12/here-goes-everything/">finishing the first leg of my education</a>.  The semester was complicated infinitly though by my promotion.  Previously I was Library Technology support.  After a major shift in the chain of command at <a href="http://www.dccc.edu/">the college</a> I was moved into Web Services, given a new title and a little bit of compensation.</p>

<p>I have been studying <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/">web standards</a> based design along with server-side languages and database driven web sites for almost two and a half years now.  My skill set has grown significantly and I had been looking for a new job that would utilize these skills.  I had a difficult time finding anything though because I had no official education and the only proof I had that I could do what I said I could do was my personal sites.  And my word... right... personal sites.  I have been given the chance to prove myself.  It's probably the best thing (professionally) that could have happened to me.  When I finished <a href="http://www.mis.temple.edu/">my degree at Temple</a> I'll also have five years of experience in an academic institution and two years in a development environment.</p>

<p>The only thing that makes it better is that I joined the team at a point just before the first redesign of the site in over a year.  I was able to influence enough to redesign using <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/">web standards</a>.  At the moment there are some hitches we are trying to overcome so the new design isn't up.  I didn't choose the design, but I am taking the design and marking it up with <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> and <acronym title="eXtensible Hypertext Markup Language">xHTML</acronym>.  WOW!  How lucky am I?</p>

<p>Plus I get along very well with the rest of the department.  We laugh and play and have fun at work.  We listen to music and make jokes about <a href="http://goat.cx">goatse</a>.  Man, jokes about <a href="http://goat.cx">goatse</a>. (Go ahead Mark.  <a href="http://goat.cx">You</a> <a href="http://goat.cx">know</a> <a href="http://goat.cx">you</a> <a href="http://goat.cx">want</a> <a href="http://goat.cx">to</a> <a href="http://goat.cx">click</a> <a href="http://goat.cx">it</a>!)</p>

<p>Cheers to Web Services at DCCC!</p>
