First I would like to preface this by saying that parasailing is alot of fun. I mean don't get me wrong regardless of what I tell you here, parasailing is wonderful. Just look at the view in these pictures taken by Jarrod and Michelle while they were up there.

Let me also preface this by saying that I am certainly not the most coordinated or sports oriented person you will ever meet. So, Trish and I strap into the harnesses as Debbie and Jonathon are up in the air, oh I don't know... 600 feet? When they come in, Trish and I move to the back of the boat and the two of us are hooked up to the parachute. They tell us when and we shoot up. As soon as we get in the air we both fly forward and were hanging upside down. As we right ourselves, I can hear the other four in the boat laughing their asses off. The guys driving the boat dip us in the water because at this point I am just hanging in my harness. You can see this in the picture here.

Back in my harness they zip us up into the wild blue yonder. It was one of the most awesome experiences. You are just floating there, 600 feet up. It's amazing. It's peaceful. It's humiliating when you slide out of your harness and the straps around your legs pull up and start strangling your wedding tackle. Which I did. Now at 600 feet I am just hanging from the harness laughing and in pain. Trish starts to try to kick me in the "ding-ding." This happened about half way through the ride so I stayed up there like that a good 6-7 minutes.

They brought us back in for another dip in the water to fix the harness so I can get back on the boat. What a flight. I'm sure these lovely pictures will cause me years of humiliation.
