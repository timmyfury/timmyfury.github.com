<p>Everytime I work an overnight at The Franklin Institute, after we get all the kids in bed, I take the main elevators down to the basement, walk through the program support shop and through the halls to the staff lounge where I keep my sleeping bag while I'm working.  The museum is quiet.  The whole building is asleep save a few employees.  There isn't a soul around.  As I round the corner from the elevators I am startled by a very large black man standing in the shop.  It happens every single time.   Without fail this man will scare me.</p>
<p>Who is he?  Its Tra Thomas of the Philadelphia Eagles.  At least it's a plastic likeness of him.  It used to reside on the third floor in the Sports challenge exhibit.  He used to hold a large cooler of gatorade in eternal plastic pour.  As you can see in the picture below the cooler has been removed and he has been tied to the pillar to keep him from tipping over while he's off of his stand.</p>
<p>As I round the corner.</p>
