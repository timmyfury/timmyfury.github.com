<p>I have worked at a furiously to get <a href="http://www.weirdhead.org/">weirdhead.org</a> up. This is the official release announcement. It's super cool and standards compliant. It validates in every possible way (xhtml, css, 508). This is good  because it's my goal to get alot of people out there to see this site and I have read relatively extensively that the best form of advertising is a <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/seo/">good   search engine optimization (SEO) campaign</a>. You have to look at the <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/urls/">URL's</a> as you cruise around the site. They are terribly clean. I am rather proud of   it. I have spent about a month and it's really magnificent. You can even submit   analysis on the pictures. Take a look. It rules. I'm gonna submit it to GAWDS to use as my in to the <a href="http://www.gawds.org/">Guild of Accesible Web   Designers</a>.</p>
<p>I worked a campin this weekend and I work another one this weekend. Last weekend   I was just shadowing Candy. This weekend will be my first night as manager. It's a relatively scary thought if you ask me. Whatever though. For those that don't know, Camp-in is a program at the <a href="http://www.fi.edu/">Franklin   Institue Science Museum</a> that lets children sleep at the museum like a camping trip. It's really rad. I love doing it. It's one of those jobs that you can believe in. Everyone thats working wants to be there. This is my fourth year.   Manager. The sound of it makes me snicker a touch.</p>
<p>I forgot to mention that Michelle is in England right now. She left like 2 days after Trish and I left for Venice. All is well with her. Here's a <a href="http://www.urbis.org.uk/">link to her museum</a>.</p>
<p>Last week I mentioned <a href="http://www.mightgrowsoft.com/">MightGrowSoft.com</a>. There is an article on there that is interesting and I don't know what the validity   of it is but heres the general jist. "Bill Gates has recently announced that he has filed an anti-trust lawsuit against the government of the United   States, claiming they use anti-competitive methods to influence other countries'   governing processes." Okay so that wasn't a jist it was the abstract of the article directly from the page. I think the site is all made up stuff to   ream Gates but i don't know. I give you the abstract because the article isn't   much more and if you go there you are forced to listen to an annoying midi rendition   of the Star Spangled Banner. Then again you might really hate yourself and want   to force yourself to be exposed to that sort of crap. If so, heres the link   - <a href="http://www.mightgrowsoft.com/news/gatesusa.html">Bill Versus The   USA</a>.</p>
<p>Wrapping up, I don't know if anyone is familiar with the <a href="http://www.chick.com/%20">Chick religious pamphlet series</a>, but if you are<a href="http://www.epsilonminus.com/darquedungeon/">   here's a spoof</a>. and last of all here are some classy articles from CNN.com this week.</p>
