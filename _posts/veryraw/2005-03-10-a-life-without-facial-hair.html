A life without facial hair... seems like no life at all.  Tomorrow I will be shaving off my beard.  I have been thinking about doing it for a while now.  What's held me up though is that I didn't know what to do with all the hair I've been saving on my face since August.  I was planning on going sideburnless.  I haven't been without sideburns since 1999.  A long time.  It sort of troubled me.  No sideburns?  Just sick.

I've decided to keep them though.  Tomorrow when I shave my beard I will retain a bit of said beard in a mean pair of sideburns.  I've also decided to do something I have been thinking about doing for a while.  I'm going to document the changes in my facial hair over the course of the summer.  There will no doubt be plenty of terrible shapes in them and I think that you should all get to enjoy them as much as I will.
