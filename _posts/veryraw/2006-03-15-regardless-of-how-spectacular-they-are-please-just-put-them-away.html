    content: Yeah, the ladies in the Y locker room like to walk around naked too.  I want to say "please, just get dressed.  Don't dry your hair using the hand dryer while you are completely naked."

    content: Trish told me stories of the Y too.  Yesterday there were two old guys standing in the locker room naked having a conversation. Standing there like they were in the mall waiting for their wives.

<p>At the gym the other night I walked into the locker room and went to the sink to wash my hands.  As I turned to leave there was a guy standing at the urinal completely naked.  He looked me right in the face and said, "hello". It's one thing to say hello to me in the locker room.  Its something completely different to say hello while you're holding yourself at the urinal.  Its something completely different if you're naked.  Saying hello to another man in the locker room while you're naked is unaccceptable.  So I look away from the guy to avert my eyes but I end up looking into the shower room directly into the face of another naked man... he says "Hello." What the hell.  So I turn to go back to my locker to get my things and leave and there's another naked man walking toward me.  Oh sweet Jesus.  I am now surrounded by naked men.  Just then.  When I think that it couldn't possibly get any worse, YMCA starts blasting over the speakers.  It had been just weird, now it was disturbing.  I got out of the way of the oncoming naked man as fast as I could so I didn't risk getting stuck in the doorway Three Stooges style with two naked men.</p> 
<p>I don't really understand why old men feel that they need to walk around the locker room naked.  There is nothing wrong with it per se, I just think that perhaps these guys should wear a loin cloth or something when they are walking to the shower.</p>
