    content: I've been with Dreamhost since the beginning of the year, and I rarely, if ever, have a problem with them. If there's any scheduled downtime, they make sure to let you know, and if there's ever really bad downtime (in the case of <a href="http://blog.dreamhost.com/2005/09/13/at-least-we-ate-lunch-beforehand/" rel="nofollow">the blackouts</a> they do their best to keep you updated. Oh, and <a href="http://blog.dreamhost.com/" rel="nofollow">their blog</a> is quite the interesting read.

<p>I signed up with <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com">Dreamhost</a> a bit ago.  I am now in process of switching hosts from liquidweb to dreamhost.  There will be some time between now and when my DNS updates tot he new server and in that time I am going to disable comments across all of my entries.  If you have input, email me at timothycrowe@gmail.com.  Otherwise we should be completely back to normal in 72 hours.</p>
<p><em>Update!</em> The switch seems to have been a success.  At least locally everything is pointing to my new host.  It also seems to be running smoothly.  Way more painless than I thought it would be.</p>
