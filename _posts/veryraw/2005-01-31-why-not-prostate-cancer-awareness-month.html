    content: It would be cool if the cufflinks had sliced cancerous prostate tissue in them. It would add a <a href="http://www.mcl.tulane.edu/classware/pathology/medical_pathology/McPath/GR_Renal/Renal39.jpg">nice color</a>.

Every one has heard a million things about breast cancer awareness and how we all need to get mammograms.  I think there used to be a breast cancer awareness month out there but I can't find evidence of that.  It seems that everyone has given up on trying to restrict this to a month and they let it sread to an entire year.

The fact is thought that more men get prostate cancer than woman that get breast cancer.  I have read somewhere that <strong>every</strong> man, given he lives long enough, will get prostate cancer.  Call it the curse of the prostate. But you here very little about it.  I blame this on the fact that its worse to see a woman with no breasts than a man with no asshole.

February is "<a href="http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=3017091">Go Red for Woman</a>" month.  It's basically heart health awareness month for woman.  They give out little red dress pins and you wear them to support women's heart health.  This is a great idea.  A small, classy momento that gives you a reminder about heart health and woman.

As the <a href="http://www.prostate-cancer.org.uk/">Prostate cancer charity</a> website tells me, March 21st through 27th is Prostate Cancer Awareness Week.  I think that all of March should be prostate cancer awareness <em>month</em>.  Men can then stand around and regale everyone with stories of the joy that there prostates have given them.  To raise money and awareness of prostate cancer we can make brown rosebud cufflinks and wear them proudly like the little red dress pin.
