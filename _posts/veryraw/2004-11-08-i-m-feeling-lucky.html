<p>I have had two <a href="http://www.microcontentnews.com/articles/googlebombs.htm">google bombs</a> pointed out to me in the last few days.  So to check these out, go to <http ://www.google.com">google, type in the search terms below, and click the "I'm feeling lucky button".</http></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/president/gwbbio.html">miserable failure</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.coxar.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/">weapons of mass destruction</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I have made those two terms links as to maintain the google bomb and to ruin the sanctity of google.</p>
