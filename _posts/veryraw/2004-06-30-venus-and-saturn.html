<p>About three weeks ago I was on my way to work from Trish's house and the sun was sort of covered with clouds. It was covered enough that it wasn't blinding but I could still see it pretty clearly when I looked at it. In the bottom right side of the sun <a href="http://analyzer.depaul.edu/paperplate/Transit%20of%20Venus/sohomdi.jpg">there was a black dot</a> that was just about to disappear from the face of the sun. Later I was reading the <a href="http://www.google.com/googleblog/2004/06/oodles-of-doodles.html">Google blog</a> (which on a completely separate note I feel they should be calling &quot;The Bloogle&quot;) from the guy who does all the <a href="http://www.google.com/holidaylogos.html">holiday Google logo's</a>. There was a logo where one of the o's was replaced with a sun with a black dot in front of it similar to the way I had seen the sun earlier in the morning. </p>
<p>Based on <a href="http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/transit/venus/city04-2.html">this time table</a> in comparison to where I was when I saw what I thought I saw, it turns out that I saw the <a href="http://www.transitofvenus.org/">transit of Venus</a>. The phenomenon only happens once every 122 years or so and I actually got to see it. The transit of Venus is almost like an eclipse. <a href="http://www.transitofvenus.org/faq.htm#what">It happens when</a> Venus moves across the disk of the sun showing a black dot in front of the sun. I suppose I shouldn't have been staring at the sun. You can keep up to date with solar phenomenon at <a href="http://www.spaceweather.com/">spaceweather.com</a> and <a href="http://www.transitofvenus.org/safety.htm">make yourself a safe viewing device</a> (or <a href="http://skyandtelescope.com/observing/objects/sun/article_101_1.asp">buy one</a>) so you can view said phenomenon.</p>
<p>Also very exciting is the Cassini spacecraft which has been heading for Saturn for about seven years is about to begin its study of the ringed planet. Cassini will be sending back pictures from Saturn and it's 31 know moons at resolutions unimaginable. I am looking forward to some of the images. You can follow what it finds on the <a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/home/index.cfm">Cassini-Huygens</a> page. I would love it if they offered an RSS feed so I could add this to my blogroll so I would always know when they updated the pictures. Hear that <acronym title="Need Another Seven Astronauts">NASA</acronym>? I want an RSS feed on your site.</p>
