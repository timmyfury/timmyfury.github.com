<h4>The media what a piece of crap...</h4>
<p>I used to read <a href="http://www.cnn.com">cnn.com</a> every single day. I mean religiously.  Then one day I realized that there was an entire world that I wasn't getting.  It seemed that there were stories that were never getting to CNN. I doubt that the problem is poor correspondents.  I think that they filter their news.  It's rather obvious when the most important things on the site deal with mainly Iraq and George Bush.  Now I'm not saying that these topics aren't important.  I just think that there is alot more to life on this planet than Geo and Iraq.</p>
<p>A few days ago I wrote about the <a href="http://veryraw.com/history/2004/11/bush-wins-we-all-lose/">travesty of an election</a> that we had.  In that entry I mentioned Fox News.  I believe Fox News is close to the worst thing that has happened to the world.  Ever.  They select stories which are violent and depressing.  They take angles on stories with the main focus being whatever will get the masses to throw up there arms in discust at the condition of the world.  This counter-productive way of reporting the news misleads and causes things to happen like this most recent election.  I trully don't believe most of the country even realized that they knew that there were other important things happening in the world outside of terrorism. Organizations like Fox News are to blame for the destruction of intelligence and inquisitiveness in America.</p>
<p>A few years ago there was an article in the <a href="http://www.delcotimes.com/">Delaware County Daily Times</a>.  This paper is easily the most biased publication I have ever gotten my hands on.  I have read the <a href="http://www.cst-phl.com/">Catholic Standard and Times</a> and felt like I was reading less propagandistic materials.  I digress.  The paper had an article about a man who was bitten by a badger.  The way they delivered the facts you would think the man was attacked by an elephant with a shark tied to its head.  This was, from what I saw, an attempt to get the people of Delaware County angry.  I could hear old and fictional  Mr. Jones on Poplar Street saying, "We got to do sompthin about them dang badgers!"</p>
<p>Everyday this newspaper has articles in it about violent, depressing things.  When they actually do run an article about something good it's in the context of 'dag, in a world full of such hate and greed, there still are a few decent people left.'  There are alot of decent people left.  But decent people don't sell newspapers, scumbags do.</p>

<h4>Enter the alternatives...</h4>
<p>After realizing that all of the news sources that I had been reading for almost two years at that point I dumped them. Dumped them like the hateful, misery seeking vultures they are.  But what was I to do.  An information addict like myself needs his fix.</p>
<p>I have read recently that more young americans are turning to shows like <a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/tv_shows/thedailyshowwithjonstewart/">The Daily Show</a> and <a href="http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/best_week_ever/series.jhtml">The Best Week Ever</a> for their news.  I think this is a great turn.  You get all the same facts that you would anywhere else but you get multiple sides.  You also get a dose of humor which most people watching Fox News could use anyway.</p>
<p>I think you should go further though.  If you are unsatisfied with the information you are getting then search deeper, search harder.  Find what you are aching for. When those get old dump them too.</p>
<p>I have found that the best sources for information are the free ones.   People and organizations which don't profit from the information that they provide are the best source out there.  They give you everything and they give you truth.  Free thinkers provide free thinkers with free information that's real.</p>
<p>For the weak and weary, for those tired of the crap that the Media Dishes us.  For those who hate the drivel of Fox News and the Delaware County Daily Times and all the money mongering whores like them around the country, I recommend you take a look at my "Frequently Visited" links on the side of the page.  This is where I find my best information.  Search out sites that provide you with what you want.  Oh and tell me about them because I am still searching.</p>
