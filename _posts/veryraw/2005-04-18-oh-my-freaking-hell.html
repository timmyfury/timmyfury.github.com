      Descriptive data is certainly nice, when it comes to photos - or anything, for that matter.
      
      I have a flickr account, but I haven't used it quite as much as I would like... Simply because I don't take pictures that often.
      
      I was thinking of a "screen shot" use for flickr. Like, for projects I am working on - take screen shots - and use flickr to manage my screen shots.... Er.. something like that.

<p>Okay(breath), anyone who has talked to me over the last month has been assaulted with talk about how amazing <a href="http://flickr.com">flickr</a> is.  Well I haven't been able to sleep for a few nights because of the sheer amount of descriptive data that is attached to each photo.  I lay awake at night thinking about the possibilities this could have.  There are already applications that have been developed using flickr's API to do pretty cool things.  <a href="http://mappr.com/">Mappr</a> is just one.  I theorize that at some point you will be able to order images and albums and posters and all sorts of things from flickr from the images you upload.</p>
<p>So anyway, the reason I bore you all with another entry about my latest obsession is that I received an email from flickr and they have decided to reward those of us that signed up for pro accounts early.  My one year has been turned into two years.  My 1gb upload per month is now 2gb per month. <strong>and to top it off</strong>, as if it could get any better, in the next few days I will have two accounts to give to two lucky friends for free.  <strong>Two freaking free pro accounts.</strong> I am beside myself.  Freaking amazing.  I don't think I'll ever sleep again. This is too damn exciting.</p>
