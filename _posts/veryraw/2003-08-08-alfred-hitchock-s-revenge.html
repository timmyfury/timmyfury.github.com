<p>So I'm walking into work from the parking lot this morning and about 3/4 of the way to the building I here all this crowing.  I look behind me and see about 25 crows on the ground about 30 feet back and they are all hopping toward me.  I quickly turn around again and fear looking back again but all I can hear is more birds landing and the crowing is getting loader and closer.  I was fucking terrified.</p>
