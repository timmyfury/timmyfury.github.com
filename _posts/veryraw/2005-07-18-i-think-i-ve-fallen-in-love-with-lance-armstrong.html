    content: Are you becoming a groupie of Lance Armstrong?  Am I going to come home and see you sporting Lance Armstrong gear and hear you saying that he has inspired you to do everything in your life?

    content: We didnt quite make it all the way to green lane that night, but that is certainly alot longer of a ride than i thought it was... We should head up to king of prussia one of these days, and i am going to have to purchase myself a bicycle.

      It was a good ride. I like the trip along Kelly Drive.  Its flat and relaxing.  
      
      Debbie, I'm not gonna wear one of those yellow livestrong wristbands or anything.  I said I'm into Lance, but I mean in the "he's awesome on a bike" sort of way.  Not in the "let me wear a yellow wristband to honor his testicles" sort of way.

    content: I'm glad to hear it Timmy.  It would be a little odd to hear of my brother honoring another man's testicles.

<p>I've grown quite fond of biking recently.  I have gone on several <a href="http://www.sueandpaul.com/gmapPedometer/?centerX=-75.31050682067871&centerY=39.911711314759685&zl=3&polyline=yosrF~gnjM~S%7BMhFnOpOqLrDdLcZbSzBhGHjd@cHnFsJlSmN%60KjVxo@rAzZtKaDv%5EvuAxIbN%7BH~IhFjOwCbHml@ps@%60A~EdEuAh@%60DcEfBgBsK~p@u%7C@_@%7BKdFiGmMmTg_@suAuGsOcD~Bs@mIaVqo@uI%60DtIkDzNgJxF_NhD%7CLs@lAdFpN%7BA%7DDjDgCwIiYf@a@iR%7Bh@lGyGeD%7BGz@uAoCsK">good</a> <a href="http://www.sueandpaul.com/gmapPedometer/?centerX=-75.20347595214844&centerY=39.99737491734879&zl=4&polyline=si%7DrF%60m%7BiMgExAyBd%5BuArBkC%60@mDQsFtAsK%60GwNzMkPpWoChKaMdRsETcDwBaHuLeQaReGsDqEiI_FoIgOmIgWgDiSa@gR~C_EpCiLt%5DkGpY%7BDtReJzMwH%5DuDvRyCzMuFzGyGzD_R%60VcNlTqIvXjDkK%60D%7BLxHwKjEmG%7CKuO%60DgE~JoGnCsEf@eDrDaPtBcKdJGhHiLhIma@~I%7B%5DxFmK~GsD%60KqAl%5Bh@~QzC%7CNlGlIpPvQdRzNzMfHdKlFYhG%7BIxEoHnDoMx%5B%7B%60@bTcKxISjB%7BG%60AoO%5CiExCgA%5C%5D">treks</a> which some may have seen in the side list of links.  As my interest in biking has grown I have also been reading Tour de France news.  Interesting stuff.  I  also heard a story about how Lance Armstrong's oversized heart and excessively efficient muscles allow him to trudge up the Alps during the tour.  Now I can't stop thinking about Lance.  I read as much as  can about him. I look at pictures of him.  It's creepy.  I have even caught myself dropping Lance trivia into conversations and going as far as saying "Lance would never do that," as if I knew him.</p>
<p>Anyway, for those of you who are not eerily obsessed with Lance but would like to see some really bizarre happenings at the tour, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mpk/sets/591459/">check out the first half of this photoset</a>.</p>
