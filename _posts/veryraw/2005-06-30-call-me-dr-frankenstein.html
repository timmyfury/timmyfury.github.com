    content: Got it.  I'll be waiting a while to get a new one when I have the money... a looong while, because everytime I get close to having the money, I'll probably spend it on something I value more... like a ticket to PR or other such silliness.

<p>I some how managed to take two broken iPods (a 10gig first generation with a dead battery and a 20gig third gen with a broken screen) and combine them into one very broken ipod that doesn't really fit together tightly and only works when its plugged into the wall.  I know you're impressed. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/timmyfury/sets/522941/">Check out the pictures.</a></p>
