<p>If you read this in RSS <a href="http://veryraw.com">click on over</a> to the site, it's been completely overhauled.  I've been working on the output of wordpress for a while.  Although I could have just downloaded a theme and skinned it, I decided not to.  I went from the ground up and built exactly what I wanted.  After mangling my site in attempts to be obnoxious after yet another insult for big fonts I thought it was time to finish off the work I'd done and make veryraw look a bit cleaner and a little more professional. </p>
<p>Although the site is best viewed in something larger than 1024x768, viewers of lesser resolution won't lose the content.  The left column is fixed width, but the right is not.  The right column will stretch to the edge of the browser window, and all the additional content in the right column will float to take up as much of the space as possible.</p>
<p>There are a few other additions to the site that I am particularly excited about.  On the homepage, the top of the right column will be occupied by quick thoughts.  These are entries about links or ideas or news that don't warrant full out articles, but I still want to note.  I think I shyed away from posting these in the past because they took up so much real estate on the homepage.  So the hope is to increase posting by assigning these to a special area.</p>
<p>The second biggest change is in the navigation of the site.  Across the top there are several links to external sites.  Some of these will eventually become content on veryraw.  I wanted to get the template up and running before I developed that content, but some of those links will change.  Furthermore, the floating bottom content in the right column is different depending on what page you are visiting.  In archives you get different lists than if you are reading an article.  The biggest benefit to all this is that I can target the content here to be as helpful as possible for the current content, rather than viewing the same additional content all the time.  Of note are the "Similar entries" column on the single article page, and the "favorite entries" in the archives area and on my 404 page.</p>
<p>The <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> was rough but it came together.  There are some details still to address which I couldn't address without the real content.  I have tons of stuff that I can add now that I have the flexible additional content areas.  Let me know what you think and if there is anything strange going on.</p>
