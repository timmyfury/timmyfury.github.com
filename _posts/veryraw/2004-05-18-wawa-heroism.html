<p>I think I need to lighten the mood a bit after two relatively dorky updates.  So I will give you all, what seems to be becoming, your weekly <a href="http://www.wawa.com/">Wawa</a> update.</p>
<p>We were at <a href="http://www.wawa.com/storelocator/storeloc-results.asp?StoreNumber=293">our Wawa</a> the other night and the night manager says to Mark that she thought someone was going to leave without paying for gas.  Mark heroically bounds out the door for pump 11.  As the woman gets in her car Mark throws himself in front of the car.  She screams, "Get the fuck out the way," and tries to leave.  Mark doesn't budge.  Mom, the manager walks out and says, "You didn't pay for yourgas."  What an amazing and selfless act.</p>
<p>Later that night after a trip to Borders we wen back for a nightcap and there was a woman broken down at the pump.  Mom again calls on us and we get her out of there with a jump.  The woman must have been terrified though.  Three relatively large men walking to her car with a middle aged Lebonese fellow.  Tony made her cry I think.  We got free coffee.</p>
<p>I have been talking to Larry Fish of the Philadelphia Inquirer about my obsession with Wawa.  It's sort of like therapy.  He's writing about Wawa.  I told him about the Wawa 500 and he was excited.  So looks like we will have to amass a list of Wawa's.  They wouldn't give me one but I found a way to get one myself from the website.  I'll get back to you on that one.  Now all we need is for Code to come home from Qatar.  If you see this code give us an update and we will get the plans going.</p>
