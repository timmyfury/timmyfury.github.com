<p>Recently Drew at <a href="http://www.allinthehead.com">all in the &lt;head&gt;</a> wrote about his ipod 
and a concept that I think is relatively awesome.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everywhere you go, you always take the weather with you &#8211; according to Crowded House at least. I don&#8217;t know about you, but I associate different types of music with different weather conditions. I noticed this particularly the other day when driving along listening to my <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/"  title="Apple digital music player">iPod</a> in the car. It was a really bright sunny morning, and each song selected by the iPod&#8217;s shuffle-play seemed to fit perfectly. Chirpy, upbeat music for a chirpy, upbeat morning.</p>
<p>This got me thinking &#8211; if I could categorise each song in my music collection with a weather type, all iTunes would need to do is grab a local weather feed in XML from <a href="http://www.weather.com/">weather.com</a> (just like <a href="http://www.1976design.com/blog/"  title="1976design.com">Dunstan</a> does) &#8211; and a customised playlist could be constructed to match the conditions outside.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Although I find the concept interesting I don't know if I would use this.  I mean its interesting and it certainly presents a challenge from a strictly programmatic point of view but I had another idea which I have thought about for a while. I think adding catagories based on <strong>mood</strong> would be a more appropriate way of going about catagorizing music.  Then when you pick up your iPod or sit down at your computer, you could just pick a mood and the computer would assemble a playlist for you.  Songs could fall into multiple mood categories.Would save alot of time and avoid you the annoyance of assembling a playlist everytime you sit down.  The problem of course is, as Drew mentions, categorizing 40gig of mp3 is a torture which no man should ever endure.</p>
<p>For a long time I have been thinking about how to approach this task.  In the hayday of download, when the cup of <a href="http://www.napster.com/">Napster</a> runneth over and <a href="http://www.audiogalaxy.com/">Audio Galaxy</a> was as extensive as the Milky Way, I used to scrap all of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata">metadata</a> attached to the songs which I downloaded.  Had I just tagged these songs properly when I downloaded them I may not be in the situation I am now.  Many gigs later I finally found the program to accomplish this goal.</p>
<p>Call me <a href="http://www.pantheon.org/articles/s/sisyphus.html">Sisyphus</a>.  I have been working now for almost two months.  I am now using MusicBrainz meta-tagger to properly tag my large collection of mp3 which Mark fondly named <a href="http://www.timmyfury.com/things/alexandria/">The Alexandria project</a> (after the <a href="http://www.bede.org.uk/library.htm">Great Library of Alexandria</a>), aka Operation Jail Time, In which we rip our Cd's (using <a href="http://www.mp3-converter.biz/buzzsaw-cd-ripper/">Buzzsaw</a>).</p>
<p>Although this has taken an egregious amount of time, I suspect that the mood tagging would not take nearly as long since there is no research involved, it is merely personal opinion.</p>
<p>All this being said, I will go home and pack my bag and wait for the RIAA to come and get me.</p>
