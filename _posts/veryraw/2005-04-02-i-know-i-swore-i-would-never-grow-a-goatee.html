    content: Oh my god that so rocks! My trimmer busted (damn those pubic hairs of steel), so my little chin scruff is getting scruffier and scruffier. You've set the bar very high there. Maybe we should organize a blogosphere beard trimming slapdown... Kind of like self-portrait day, but with hair. Oh my god I am so going to do it!

<p>But, can you really call this a goatee?  My latest shave is probably my best to date.  I don't know if I can ever top this.  I'll try.  I swear I will but I realy don't think it gets any better. Enjoy!</p>
