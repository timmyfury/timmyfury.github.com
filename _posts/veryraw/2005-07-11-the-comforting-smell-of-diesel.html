      My mom never described her job like that.  The story I got was, "It is hard horrible work.  Get a degree."  
      
      Jonathan begins @ USAirways soon.  Hope he enjoys it as much as you and realizes there are other occupations in the world.

      I hope he realizes the same.  It's great fun for a 19 year old kid.  A horrible torment for a mother of 2. It took me a year and a half but the important thing is that all the while I was still taking classes.  I didn't take a full semester but I still took classes.
      
      He'll learn quickly to hate the schedule.  The need to be there everyday.  For someone much older a schedule like that works, but it gets in the way of alot of fun too.

    content: The life of a great man attends me now, this job is wickedly great.  I work 4AM-1030AM, everyday I see the beautiful sun rise every morning and greet me with a stupendous hug, while the wind whispers "Nice to see you again Jonathan."  After my daily wake up call, I gladly hop in the tug and race to my friends with the wings.

<p>Although I enjoy my job at <a href="http://dccc.edu/">the college</a> immensely, there was once a job that I enjoyed more.  After dropping out of Millersville University, I got a job at USAirways. I threw bags; loaded the bellies of planes.  I loved that job like Woah!, but in time realized that someday I would want more then aching knees and back. I left the job and took a less certain path.</p>
<p>I do miss that job, though. I miss racing around on those tugs and conveyor belts.  Throwing other people's things around with wanton regard.  The excitement as the engines screamed near your head and threw anything in their path across the tarmac.  I miss the dominos in the breakroom with guys three times my age.  We mocked and taunted each other as we slammed the dominos on the table with vigar and screamed "<strong>pants!</strong>" at full volume when we threw down some points.</p>
<p>It was the thrill of doing something that others didn't get to do.  When the plane was coming in you would watch the monitors as the status updated to "arrived" and your gates team would grab their things and rush out the door to greet the customer. Working hard to get the freight or bags to the baggage claim or to another plane to make a quick connection then loading the next flight's cargo to get the flight out on time.</p>
<p>If you work for an airline on the gates you'll read this and laugh at the romanticized version of what goes on behind the scenes of an airline. It's dirty, hard, honest work, but I loved doing it.  To this day everytime I drive behind a diesel truck on a cool morning, I am comforted by the memories of those carefree laid back mornings on the ramp at Philadelphia International.</p>
