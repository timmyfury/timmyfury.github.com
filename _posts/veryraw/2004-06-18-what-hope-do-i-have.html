<p>I was reading this article on BBC News about <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3811785.stm">teleportation</a>. Apparently scientists have teleported atoms successfully for the first time.  In the article though it says, "Experts say being able to do the same with massive particles like atoms could lead to new superfast computers."</p>
<p>By <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom">wikipedia's</a> account, "An atom is the smallest portion into which a chemical element can be divided while still retaining its properties." Looking at the weight of a molecule of iron (which is made up of atoms)at 55.845 amu or 55 grams at one mol, I begin to wonder.  If an atom is considered massive, what hope does a 250lb bastard like me ever have of being teleported to Wawa before I die?</p>
