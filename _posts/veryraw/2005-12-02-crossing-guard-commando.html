<p>I often joke about paramedics, calling them Paramedic Commando, as they scream by in a haze of lights and sirens.  They swerve in and out of traffic.  Driving in the wrong direction and through red lights.  Then in a convenience store they walk around like hot shit, listening to there walkie talkies and talking about all kinds of important things like flashlights and badges.  These guys actually serve an important function though so I'll accept it.  It takes a lot to gather up someones brains or intestines and rush them to the hospital.  These guys might actually deserve the title of commando, however crazy they may be.</p>
<p>I have forever been amazed at the delusional crossing guards in this area.  They seem to forget that a car can rip their bodies to bits.  They have zero regard and will walk out in front of your car with only a raised stop sign to protect them.  Your stop sign will not protect you!  I call them Crossing Guard Commando.  This was a play on the aformentioned Paramedic Commando.  The other morning Trish and I were driving to work together and a crossing guard walked out in front of me in full camoflage.  Glad to see that my jokes have real world punchlines.</p>
