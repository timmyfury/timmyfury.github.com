      He's back! So why the change to a completely new URI?? Just wondering. Good to see you're back, and I'm looking forward to some good readin'.....
      You're right, WP is easy to hack once you find your way around it, and the wealth of info available at the Wiki and Forums is great. Not to mention the plugins. Aahhhh, the plugins.

      The reason for the URI switch...
      I was getting tired of the old one.  I wanted a new persona.  Something different.

<p>Here I am again.  After months of nothing I have grown tired of not having a blog. I went through about a thousand different new website names and even more scenerios for what the site should be.  I have built at least ten different blog scripts, okay half way built, and thrown them out.  In the end I decided to use <a href="http://wordpress.org/">wordpress</a>.  Its a good application and its easy to modify once you get the hang of how it operates. </p>
<p>The style sheeting isn't done yet and I will probably be finishing it within the week.  I haven't done the about page and I haven't done the contact page but I have things to write about and the links are piling up.  I will also be posting some of the old content from timmyfury.com here eventually.  Slowly but surely.</p>
