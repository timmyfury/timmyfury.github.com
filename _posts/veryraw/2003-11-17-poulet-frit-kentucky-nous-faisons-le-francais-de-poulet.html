<p>About three months ago I posted a picture that my dad had sent me from a bussiness trip that he was on in Quebec, Ontario. It's right here. A picture of a Kentucky   Fried Chicken sign. Instead of KFC its called PFK (Poulet frit Kentucky). It appears to be the only place on earth where the restaurant's moniker is in <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/indepth/language/">a foreign language</a>. I was looking for what PFK actually stood for and although   I mean what the acronym itself stands for I found out what KFC aka PFK does stand for. They stand for chicken addiction. It turns out that there is a chemical additive in KFC that makes their chicken irresistable. Thats pretty sweet. I need to inject some of that shit into my web design skills. Then maybe I could get a fucking job.</p>
<p>Then there is this site which is apparently run by retards. The title is funny though, "<a href="http://www.kfccruelty.com/">Kentucky Fried Chicken does chickens wrong</a>." I mean seriously, come on people, do you really love chickens that much that you would devote that much of your time and money to saving them?  Go ahead, try to deny that they are deliscious. I dare you. What a dumb thing to devote a website to. For all those of you that are thinking the same thing about me, SHUT UP!</p>
<p>Okay so I went and saw <em>ELF </em>yesterday. Very funny. But here's the reason I'm telling you this. <em>Brother bear</em> and <em>Looney Tunes: Back in Action</em> are also playing. So the movie theater reeked of children. I had gas (for something new right?). I found a new really funny game to play. Eat a bunch of foods that give you gas. Then go somewhere thats mobbed with children. Then... I bet you saw this coming... fart... alot. They are all right at ass level and they get slapped in the face by your ass. It's fucking great. Try it. No really, try it, it's fun.</p>
