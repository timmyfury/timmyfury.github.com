      well i did it from my aunt's home in ashtabula, oh. directions were dead on.  only 8hrs and 37mins.
      
      By the way, I don't think dccc is challenging for you anymore.  After you get your BS, you should apply with google.

      Looks great. Only suggestion is to somehow change it so it prints out the address you are going to instead of the long. and lat. (Once you get to the google directions). One other note: Google Maps doesn't recognize 901 South Media Line Rd, Media, PA 19063 as a valid address, it does recognize S. Media Line Road or Media Line Road.

    content: "There are some issues with certain campuses.  Downingtown doesn't exist on the map yet and the address we use for the Exton campus doesn't exist either.  Thats the reason I needed to use the coordinates. "

<p>Since I started working in the web services department at the college, we have slowly been weeding through the content on the pages of the site.  Making things easier to find and making sure information is only maintained in one place has been a key objective of ours.  Basically its easier to maintain and less confusing to our customers.  It was pointed out to me in a meeting yesterday that it was nearly impossible to find directions to the various campuses on our site.  The issue was that they were buried in a page that had a list of campuses.  The campus names linked to pages that profiled the campus.  On that page there was a link to the directions for that campus' county.  Then finally on that page you would click on a link that jumped to the part of the page that had the directions to that campus.  Little bit of overkill.</p>
<p>Since google released the <acronym title="application programming interface">API</acronym> for their maps I have been toying with them and attempting to get them to do what I wanted them to do so I could improve the directions on the college's homepage.  So after my meeting yesterday, when it was made abundantly clear to me that I was not the only person who had issues with the directions situation on the site, I sat down and forged through and finished the map.  You can see it on the <a href="http://www.dccc.edu/locations/">locations page</a>.  I am really very excited about this.  You click on one of our locations and get a form to enter your address and when you submit you go to <a href="http://local.google.com/">google local</a> for directions from your door to ours.</p>
<p>Not only that but I also streamlined the content on that page so they linked only to directions and maps for each location.  This of course is all in an effort to make the site more usable for our customers.  After all, if they can't find the school, they can't sign up for classes and thats why we're here.</p>
