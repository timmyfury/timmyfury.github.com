    content: As big and bad as the human population has managed to convince itself that it is, that picture really puts things into perspective... "You're not that significant in the grand scheme of things."

<p>I looked at this image as "Miranda That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore" from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0007GAEW6/qid=1111554316/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/002-8070210-8055264">the new The Mars Volta album</a> hit its big trumpet blasts (if you ain't heard it you better go hear it) and a chill crescendo went down my spine for about a minute.  I seriously thought I was going to pass out.  The original is from <a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap050322.html">APOD</a>.  Makes me feel very small in a very big way.</p>
