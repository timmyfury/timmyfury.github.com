      Yeah, I really hate the "splash screen." Somethings gotta be done about that. Worst is when you don't know it's a PDF, and you end up launching something you didn't want to. So pointless and aggravating.
      
      'PDF Download' sounds interesting. I might try it. I wonder if it works on a Mac.

      I believe there is a greasemonkey script that will add a PDF icon to all PDF links in your browser.  It's always good form to note that a link is a PDF though.  I have been thinking about implementing a PDF class in the stylesheet at the college that would put a PDF icon after PDF links.
      
      The PDF Download plugin also gives you the choice of viewing in HTML.  I knew I forgot something.

<p>If you are like me, you hate adobe acrobat.  PDF's are such a flaming hassle that when you see one, you don't even want to deal with it.  I would rather just not read some important information than load Acrobat to view a PDF.  It is widely accepted that a two page PDF can bring a quad-processor 20,000 ghz computer with 4,000,000 megs of RAM and a 256,000 meg video card to its knees in seconds and leave it begging for it's Mommy.</p>
<p>I recently installed this firefox extension called <a href="http://www.rabotat.org/firefox.html">PDF Download</a>.  When you are cruising along the internet and you inadvertantly click a link to a PDF, PDF Download prompts you, do you want to open in a new tab, download to the desktop or cancel.  This way you can go on with your day rather than spend the rest of time waiting to regain control of your browser all the while contemplating how awesome Chinese water torture must feel.</p>
<p>All that said, although we have made a very valiant effort to eliminate PDF from the college website altogether, we have been forced to use it in some instances.  I recently downloaded acrobat reader 7.  What a difference.  Load time is down significantly.  Seriously like Captain quick launch. It's nearly immediate, with no splash screen. They still haven't done anything about the entire document being redrawn every time you move the document though so it will still lame your computer.  You'll just have to wait less time for the laming.</p>
