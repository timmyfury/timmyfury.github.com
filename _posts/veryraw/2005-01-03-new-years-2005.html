<p>Michelle, Trish and I went to the Penn's Landing fireworks on New Years Eve then Trish and I went to the Mummer's parade the next morning.  We couldn't see anything at the parade at City Hall so we tried to meet up with Geoff's family at Broad and Passyunk.  No dice.  We got off of the subway too early and walked 12 blocks to meet them.  It was over by the time we got there.  We saw a very little bit though.  <a href="http://www.mummers.com/">The Mummers parade</a> is such a bizarre tradition.  All these big tough men get together and put on their best sequin jump suit and dance through the town.  <a href="http://veryraw.com/history/2005/01/newyears2005/">Deep link</a> for more images. Some of them are mine, some of them are Trish's</p>
