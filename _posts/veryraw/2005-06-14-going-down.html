<p>A few weeks ago when we went to <a href=http://veryraw.com/history/2005/05/someones-gonna-lose-a-finger/">South of the Border</a> we took a trip up into <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/timmyfury/16690617/in/set-400721/">the big sombrero</a> there. As we came down in the elevator Michelle snapped picture after picture.  She put them into a set and I thought it was pretty rad.  So go to the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/bratacious/sets/413653/show/">slidshow</a> and set the speed to 1 second.  It's pretty cool how the pictures ended up looking like a stop motion film.</p>
