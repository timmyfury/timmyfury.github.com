    content: I've posted this link before but I felt that it was appropriate in the spirit of what Jeff Tweedy is saying in <em>Who Owns Culture</em>.  If there was ever an example of art building on art, this video of <a href="http://www.lowmorale.co.uk/creep/" rel="nofollow">Radiohead's Creep based on the characters from Low Morale</a> is it.

<p>I posted <a href="http://wilcoworld.net/wired/">this link</a> a few weeks ago.  Its a talk given by Jeff Tweedy and Lawrence Lessig called <em>Who Owns Culture</em> given at the New York Public Library.  Download it.  If you can't get a good seed message me and I will send it to you.  It's a good talk.  There are some visuals that I totally missed because I listened to it in the car but if you have time I'm sure the video is good too.</p>
<p>Regardless they make some great points and some wonderful discussion.  They discuss the fact that the movie industry and music industry and publishing industry have taken control of, or attempted to take control of creativity and culture at large.  They discuss how copyright is stiffling creativity. It's control is against the spirit of art where creativity builds on creativity and influences the future and the way people think and feel.</p>
<p>I was just going to leave it as a link on the side, but then I heard a piece called <em><a href="http://www.autistici.com/petsounds.htm">hippocamp ruins pet sounds</a></em>.  I was led to the project from who knows where and I downloaded the album.  It's the 25th anniversary tribute to the Beach Boys album <em>Pet Sounds</em>.  It's amazing.  I really enjoyed it.  A couple weeks later I saw <a href="http://downhillbattle.org/node/view/505>this post on downhill battle</a>.  Autistici was forced to take this work offline for copyright reasons.</p>
<p>It was infuriating to me.  It's crap.  Why stiffle a work that, if you read the bit about it on the <a href="http://www.autistici.com/petsounds.htm">autistici</a> page they are obviously paying tribute to and encouraging purchase of the album.  But they were forced to take it down.  This brings forward the rediculous nature of the beast.  The lack of forward thinking and the control of the greedy suits who control the industry.</p>
<p>I liked the opinions of Lessig and Tweedy.  I think that technology will lead to a future more like the vision of these two forward thinkers.  Download <em><a href="http://wilcoworld.net/wired/">Who Owns Culture</a></em>, download <em><a href="http://downhillbattle.org/node/view/505">hippocamp ruins pet sounds</a></em>.  They are worth it and these two pieces together are really shine an enormous beacon on the problems in the copyright world.  Oh and if these downloads don't work I have both at home; contact me and I'll send them to you.</p>
