    content: I'm at a loss here. I just can't fathom how so many people could want such a damn idiot to run the country. I thought most of the population were a bunch of mindless sheep, now I am sure of it. It's just depressing to know how fuckin stupid people <i>really</i> are.

<p>The anger grows by the minute.  I started the day half joking about it.  Itâ€™s now 11:00 and I am near catastrophic anger levels.  So angry I canâ€™t even express.  I stutter and I repeat.  I start the conversation over again with the next guy. </p>

<p>I stare at that map of the country and see only a third of the countryâ€™s area in blue.  I click further and I find that each blue state was carried by two, maybe three blue counties.  Population centers across the country took half the vote.  Diverse populations of educated, open-minded people took half the vote.  Look at the country as a whole.  Pin point those centers.  You have a mass of red with twenty or thirty blue specks.  What were you all thinking?  </p>

<p>Iâ€™ve seen more people cry today then cried at the last funeral I went to; people with more education than thirty Texans.  Iâ€™ve sworn more today then ever in my life.  I swear a lot.</p>

<p>Since I started following the campaign, nearly a year and a half, I have sworn up and down that Iraq was not an issue.  It wasnâ€™t until today that I realized that it was.  All along Iraq mattered and I didnâ€™t even know.  What is George going to do when two of my closest friends go to Iraq?  Why do my Jarrod and my Code have to worry about whether they are going to be sent away to fight a pointless war.  What is George going to do when the draft starts again? Why should my Mark and my Geoff and myself have to worry about whether their unlucky day is going to be called.  Why do my Trish and my Maureen and my Mom and my sisters have to cry at night as I dodge bullets?</p>

<p>How does that manâ€™s marriage to that man have anything to do with your marriage?  Maybe itâ€™s that beer.  Maybe itâ€™s that TV.  Maybe itâ€™s your 22 year old secretary who blows you first thing every morning.  Why does it matter to you?</p>

<p>The Bush-voting masses will never know the freedoms they are losing.  Theyâ€™ll be too busy watching the Fox News coverage of the elevated terror level.  Theyâ€™ll be too busy sucking Bushâ€™s cock for making them safe.  Theyâ€™ll be too busy living in their dream world that Osama bin Laden gives a single ratâ€™s fuck about Rudyard, Montana or Altus, Oklahoma or Wapiti, Wyoming.</p>

<p>We are searching for Islamic Fundamentalists in other parts of the world. Who will seek us?  Who will root our conservative religious far-right fundamentalists out?  Who will seek them in their trailers? Who will pull them from their tractors?  Who will push them from their stools as they milk their cows? Who will knock their Bud Lights out of their hands as they watch Dale Jarrett round the north wall at the Daytona 500?</p>

<p>Fuck John Kerry for not being the guy.</p>

<p>Fuck George Bush for what heâ€™s done.  Fuck George Bush for what heâ€™ll do.</p>

<p>Fuck the American people for being the ignorant, uneducated, immoral mass of beer swilling, socially incontinent retard hicks that they have proven themselves to be.</p>

<p>My rant could continue ad nauseum.  Forever probably, but Iâ€™ll spare you my incoherency.  Iâ€™ll spare you my anger.  You probably have enough yourself.</p>
