A few days after I wrote my last entry I received a comment from an old friend.  I was curious to see how they found me.  I searched for names they would have called me.  You know... derivatives of my name, not the names I am generally called on a regular basis (some too nasty to mention here).  "Tim Crowe", "Timmy Crowe"... nothing.  "Timothy Crowe"? Nothing? What? What the fuck happened?

Well the last time I did a search for Timothy Crowe, I came up with four general results...
<ol>
<li>Timothy Crowe the business professor in Auckland, New Zealand</li>
<li>Timothy Crowe the stage actor</li>
<li>Timothy Crowe the criminologist</li>
<li>Timothy Crowe the web developer</li>
</ol>

The last one being me.  Of course the nature of my profession gave me a higher standing in the results.  I came up all over the place.  Postings on forums, my professional page at the college, and a few of the other sites that I have profiles at.  This had caused some confusion in the past.  I have recieved emails from people looking for Timothy Crowe the criminologist.  Enough that I have a pre-formed email to send in response to help these poor souls find the proper Timothy Crowe.

Now its like google doesn't even know me.  There are all these other Timothy Crowe's out there.  I'm scared.  It's picked up my 43things profile (a site that tracks goals which I started playing with like a week ago) but has kicked veryraw off the front page altogether (and all subsequent pages as well).  I read an article about what happens to small business' when google changes their algorithms.  They lose online traffic because they lose their places.  But seriously, Losing your own freaking name?  That's rediculous!
