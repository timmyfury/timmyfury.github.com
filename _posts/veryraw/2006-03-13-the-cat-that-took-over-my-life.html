<p>Shortly after Trish and I moved in to the apartment together we were sitting there thinking, "Damn, this apartment is really nice and roomy.  We should get something that makes this apartment seem restrictive and small."  So naturally we went out and got ourselves a cat.Now that we have the cat the apartment is not nearly large enough.  I don't know if it has anything to do with the cat for real or if its something in my head that makes me feel as if the cat is taking up more than his share of the apartment, but thats how it is.</p>
<p>It really is amazing how quickly the apartment filled up with cat related things.  The tunnel, the tower and about 2000 mice have taken residence in our apartment.  Not to mention the food and water, and the litterbox.  Then there's the constant conversation with and about the cat.  You would think the thing actually knew what the hell we are talking about.</p>
<p>Having a kitten strikes me as it might be like having a baby.  Sleep some nights is impossible.  4:30 every morning, he wakes Trish up for god knows what reason.  I could accept this from a dog who needed to go out.  The cat has a litterbox though.  Two days ago he knocked over the ironing board and woke me with a start and now and again I wake up with the cat sitting on my chest staring me in the face.</p>
<p>Regardless, having the cat around is sorta fun.  He's annoying and constantly wants to lay across my keyboard while I'm working, but it makes the apartment feel a little bit more like a home.  I just can't wait to get a house.  Then we'll have some real room.  Then we'll get a couple of dogs or something and be right back where we started.</p>
