<p>Trish arrives at 11:13 tonight <a href="http://www.timmyfury.com/history/patricialess/">from Belize</a>. There is a pit in my stomach that makes me feel like I am on the <a href="http://pws.chartermi.net/%7Ecsai/models/gravitron.html">Gravitron</a> at the greatest carnival on earth. Until 7:00 tonight, it had been thirteen days since the last time I have talked to her. I am nervous to see her. Nervous like I haven't been since I first fell in love with her. I have missed her so much. I am glad she went away and I didn't have any contact with her though. When someone is gone you really learn how much you love them. You really learn what it means to miss someone. </p>
<p>It's amazing the things that you miss. Those pokes in the side as you are driving. The incorrectly worded clich&eacute;s (&quot;Wallow in your pities&quot;). Those times when she says something really bizzarre that doesn't really make sense and isn't really appropriate for the situation, you both stop and look at each other and she's all, &quot;shut up&quot; (Oh no! My pink frilly). It's been thirteen days since I've kissed her or hugged her or told her I love her. She's in big trouble when she gets off that plane. I'ma get her.</p>
