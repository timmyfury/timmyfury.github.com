      The movie also felt hollow, it lacked depth, and I didn't believe it, which when building a fantasy world is the most important thing you can do. You have to believe these fantastic things are real. The characters were one dimensional, the story was predictable, there was no explanation why the queen was evil and why the lion was good. Why are they fighting? Where is the history and founding of the "Deep Magic?" Where did all the monsters come from? 
      
      The symbolism didn't bother me, teh lack of any qualities that would make this a compelling film bothered me. It felt cheap and plastic. 
      
      Plastic like the face of The Burger King.

      ahh, from your review i see you never read the books. yeah i expected all that stuff to be in there, which is why i was worried about a non-bbc on screen translation. The <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094500/" rel="nofollow">bbc"Wonderworks" version</a> had plenty of gore and dark overtones, but it still followed up with biblical symbolism. You have to kindof look the other way when it comes to this or it will make you feel ill.
      
      I cant really say anything to this version's depth, but the former version did alot of explaining, which, while more dull, developed the world in a three dimensional way.

    content: i didn't see the new film. the problem is that we all start with The Lion, the Witch, and The Wardrobe as if it's the first book in the series. The first book is actually The Magician's Nephew. I think if they are going to make a whole series of films then that should have been the one to start with. CS Lewis has been hailed as one of the greatest christian philosophers of the modern era. he struggled throughout his life with believing in god and is actually a pretty interesting historical figure. knowing that about him may have helped understand the world of Narnia and reading the book first may have also helped. I am not defending the film. I haven't even seen it, but i think the series of books is fantastic, christian symbolism or not.

      Natalie, I'm not commenting on the books.  I never read them so I can't opine. C.S. Lewis is not the only writer to use Christian symbolism. Several of my favorite books are sprinkled with it.  I'm saying that the problem with the movie is that the Christian symbolism was turned into a Christian dog and pony show.  There was nothing symbolic about it.
      
      If Lord of the Rings had been a steaming pile of shit, I would have said so whether the books were amazing or not.  They are two completely seperate medium and I'm sure there have been several movies that were awesome but had shit books accompanying them.
      
      Still, the fucking Burger King was in the movie.  I mean seriously, I love the Burger King, but not in my movies.

      Just for an example: Candyman the movie was infinitly better than it's short story. Whether you like horror or not is where subjectivity on the quality of the movie rears it's head.
      
      Oh, and fuck that guy, he was totally The Burger King.

    content: sheesh, i know that tim. i was just trying to let you know some more about the series and its author. and the lord of the rings movies were too long and needed to see an editing room. badly. that's where a film maker was trying to hard to be to close to the original medium.

      get your heads out of your asses you pompous bastards. this is a children's fantasy story for crying out loud. you all need to learn to take certain things in life for what they are and not waste your time pretending to figure out what they're worth. don't stress about the underlying religious content of a childrens fantasy book, how old are you?
      cs lewis converted to christianity and loves god forever. all stories root from the same stories before it. if you try hard enough you can link any story/hollywood blockbuster to the bible. the story takes place during a real goddamn war.  some balls you have. what unique thinkers. im so shocked and intrigued that you blew the whistle on this movie with a clever title like "jesus the witch and the wardrobe" VERY RAW you poorly misguided filth. happy new year! :)

    content: Moses, regardless of the "underlying religious content", I thought this movie was garbage.  It's obvious that the story was thinned out too much for the movie.  It was hollow and unconvincing. I would hardly call this movie a blockbuster. Plus, with the obvious appearance of the Burger King at the end, can you honestly take this movie seriously.  I'm all for suspended disbelief but their is only so far it can take you.

      Moses, if you try hard enough you can link any story/hollywood movie to the bible, that's true, but stopping your research there is just lazy, but I imagine fulfilling. In reality most of todays stories and movies go back even further than the Bible and are rooted in sumerian legend, some older. The themes of human story telling are ancient, and It's a very christan-centric idea to think that the bible, a mere 2000 year old book (new testament) was the first original story ever told. The old Testament is much older, but by no means of the sort of antiquity I am writing about.
      
      As for the movie, it took me weeks to stop thinking about how bad it was. It was, to put it lightly, a poor movie. Try to hide behind that fact that it was meant for children; Shrek and Shrek 2 were also meant for children, but were excellent movies.
      
      The fact of the matter is that the story could not carry the symbolism, and because of that weakness the symbols became overbearing.
      
      Congratulations, even a movie based on the bible can be a total shit pie.

      \r\n\
      Don't you see how that is the most self-contradictory statement it is possible to make? If the two art forms are, indeed, completely seperate media (which is not entirely true anyway, they are not *completely* seperate) then how could you say that the film about X was better or worse than the book? That is comparison!\r\n\
      \r\n\
      I agree with what I think you're getting at though: the idea that movies and books cannot be compared. In my opinion there is as much merit in comparing TLWAW the book to TLWAW the film as comparing the Eiffel Tower to the smell of cut grass.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      As far as religious imagery goes yeah it's just a clumsy allegory isn't it? But then you couldn't give the whole bible to a kid - it's got far too much evil shit in it."

    content: Luke, again I should have pointed out, I just thought the movie was horrible.  Very lame.  Perhaps <em>Lord of the Rings</em> set my standards too high for a fantasy movie.  The Religious content though didn't bother me.  It was the weak attempt at it.  It was just too obvious to let the story tell itself.

<p>I knew going into this movie that there was some layer of Christian symbolism to it.  I had heard on NPR that it was the conservative right's response to <em>Lord of the Rings</em> and <em>Harry Potter</em>.  Furthermore, I have read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060652896/ref=reg_hu-wl_item-added/002-5824911-8092810?%5Fencoding=UTF8&v=glance&n=283155">The Screwtape Letters</a> by C.S. Lewis and know a little about him;  beside the fact that a significant portion of the books written from 1800 through 1960 has some level of religious symbolism.  That aside, the film <em>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</em> had a rediculous amount of religious symbolism. I don't even think I can call it symbolism though.  Symbolism is generally subtle.  Its implied not forced.  The imagery in <em>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</em> was so obnoxious that it ruined the movie for me.</p>
<p>A few examples for you...</p>
<ul>
<li>the betrayal of Aslan by Edmund</li>
<li>the insuing forgiving of Edmund</li>
<li>Aslan's ultimate sacrifice</li>
<li>the rediculous unexplained resurrection that followed</li>
<li>the bizarre appearance of Santa Clause handing out Christmas presents that had nothing to offer to the story what-so-ever.  He magically knew exactly what the three kids would need to win the lame battle at the end.</li>
</ul>
<p>My other complaint is the complete lack of realism in the battle.  No blood, no gore? It's a battle for god's sake.  Give me something. </p>
<p>The cincher was at the end though.  The kids are all grown up in Narnia-time and as they ride into view in the forest Peter looks like the Burger King.</p>
