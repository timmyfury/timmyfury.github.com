<p>I found this wonderful spread in the May 2006 issue of <em>National Geographic</em>.  Page 12 features a story of a man from Azerbaijan who was once a school teacher.  He was chased from his home from invading Armenians troops.  He now works in a salt marsh to support his family.  He never sees his children because he has to work so much and his body has decayed from the work he does.</p>
<p>On the facing page, an advertisment for LG.  Life's Good. That's some great irony for you.  Good job <em>National Geographic</em>.</p>
