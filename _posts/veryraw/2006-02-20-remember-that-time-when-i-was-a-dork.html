<p>Once upon a time, I heard this mp3, <a href="/files/the_dead_alewives_dungeons_and_dragons.mp3">The Dead Alewives - Dungeons and Dragons</a>.  It made me laugh a lot because it so accurately portrait the life of the D&D dork.  Well this morning <a href="http://www.grindinglight.com/blog/">Burn</a> linked me to this google video, <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7521044027821122670&pr=goog-sl">Fear of Girls</a>.  I am so glad we never got this bad.  It's still pretty accurate.</p>

<p>I'm glad I got through that phase of my life.  By the way, if anyone knows where I can get a big bag of random <a href="http://www.sfr-inc.com/dragondice.htm">Dragon Dice</a>, let me know.</p>
