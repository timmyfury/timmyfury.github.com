Funny thing about the picture above is that my affinity for depicting myself in blues and reds hasn't changed.  What else hasn't changed is my bizarre and somewhat crude drawing style.  I have more of my first grade drawings and you will see in a few days that my sense of humor then was as outlandish as it is now.  Anyway.  Mark says that I am a prophet.  He thinks the ghost behind me is a glum sars cloud.  It would be glum because of how inaffective it is as a killer.  So the prophecy would be 'when I start dressing like a cowboy, an insignificant disease will sweep the land and kill very few.'  Being that I wear a big texas belt buckle, own several cowboy hats and ride a horse to work everyday.

We are doing probabilities in class. We were studying dice and the probabilities of them and Mr. Maruca says, "...you can't roll higher then a 6, we aren't playing dungeons and dragons." I could almost hear the record scratch.
