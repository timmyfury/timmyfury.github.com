    content: "I must admit, i poo-pooed Tim's picture taking extravaganza, but i would like to recind that comment in the light of this particular photograph. its stuff like that, the Unoppressive Non-imperialist Bargain Bookstore, that make pictures worth taking. While i still dont want everyone knowing where i go and what i do, especially the papertrail people, i fully support your desire for such a thing, if only to prove that your life is as rediculous as you make it out to be.

      Having the same issue in Chicago in terms of raising public trans rates.  Chicago is currently very reasonable in terms of prices ($1.75 single fare w/ 25 cent transfer that lets you have 2 transfers w/in 2 hrs, including back on the line you started on), gets you all over the city, runs all night on some lines (no stupid El shuttle), goes to the airport, and provides me with a thing of beauty called the UPass every semester ($83 for *4 months* of unlimited transport -- sweet!).
      
      However, Chicago does have some ass slow busses, greasy windows, trash all around, bums peeing on El seats (yes...), and no bathrooms at all.
      
      But the point here is that the system is about to change.  CTA is bleeding money every year.  They are begging IL for $$, which is prob not going to happen b/c the state doesn't like giving all the $$ to Chicago.  This week there is a public meeting to discuss 4 ugly alternatives, all of which increase prices and decrease service, including possibly eliminating overnight service, which would blow to say the least.  I'm hoping something good happens.  I'm willing to pay more $$ for what I consider to be a pretty good system, but would like to think that we are going to have some kind of state support miracle.
      
      Back to dissertation writing.  Happy birthday Tim!

      Puerto Rico has been "working" on their under-above ground Metro for several years now.  They're retarded.  While it's still in the free ride stage, it only runs on weekends... if that.  It's also slow as hell.  
      
      What they do have pretty good (atleast in the San Juan metropolitan area) is the bus system... of course, that's all they have, so it needs to be somewhat good.  For 25 or 50 cents, depending on the route, you can hop on the bus and go.  Unfortunately, the last runs are made shortly after 11 on the routes that run the latest... service is cut earlier on the other routes, you know, the un-important ones that don't run into Old San Juan... Oh well and then you have the fact that while some of the routes may have posted that they run every 10 minutes Monday to Friday, they actually only come by like once every 45 minutes... and because of this lack of service, the bus is already full when it pulls out of the terminal.  
      
      Try travelling around all day without a car in Puerto Rico...

      Maureen, there is nothing worse than thinking "ooh, empty El car!" only to realize that the reason it is empty is because some homeless guy who hasn't washed in many weeks is filling the car with a permeating urine scent.  It gets on you.  You don't want to be in that car at all.  A warning for you all if you ever venture out to Chicago.
      
      ps. To follow up on the travel situation here, unless we get state funding the following will happen (as voted upon last night by the CTA): Fares up to $2 and no more good transfers.  You just have to pay $2 again.  Service cut to Sunday hours.  :(

    content: damn! i didn't know it was yer b-day! we gotta go get our drinky on. as to pt fares...septa is like the reactive goo in ghostbusters 2. philadelphia is one seething ball of hate, therefore our public transportation is equally spiteful towards its citizens. more logical-misappropriation of funds, embezzlement and a workers that won't share the cost of heathcare with the company.

<p>Trish and I spent Saturday trekking around New York City. It was a beautiful day and we needed to do something with ourselves rather than sit around all weekend while I wallowed around in the crushing depression that comes along with every birthday.  I turned 25 yesterday and its the first time in as-long-as-I-can-remember years that I didn't end up contemplating how to begin my dark memoirs. We saw <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4577331">William Wallace's sword</a>, visited the <a href="http://moma.org/">MoMA</a>, and walked around the city a bunch.</p>
<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/timmyfury/sets/223546/">Check out my pictures from the trip on flickr</a>.</p>
<p>Saturday was also my first experience with the <a href="http://www.mta.nyc.ny.us/">New York City subway system</a>.  I was really impressed.  After spending the day traveling on MTA, with great ease, even with my learning curve, for only seven dollars, it was hard to return home to Philadelphia to our beloved El.  I love taking public Transportation.  Until my iPod broke, it was my prefered method of travel every Thursday to get to Temple.  But, New York is now the third city that has left me pondering the same question.  Why do we pay for this? Septa recently tossed around the idea of raising rates again and at the time I was all, "so what." Now I have new feelings on the subject.</p>
<p>In New York, they have clean, well stocked bathrooms.  Philadelphia has Bum piss.  New York has eager, helpful employees.  Philadelphia has sour grapes. New York, Paris and Boston all have expansive underground transportation systems that allow you to get nearly anywhere in the cities that you want to go.  Philadelphia has an ass slow bus system with windows so greasy you can't see out of them and piles of chicken bones in the corner.</p>
<p>I like New York.  Third trip there in as many years and everytime I like it more.  MTA gave me one more reason to love New York and one more reason to forswear Philadelphia.  Raise the rates of public transportation? For what?</p>
