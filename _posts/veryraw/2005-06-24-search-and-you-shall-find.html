<p>So the month is winding down which means its time for me to check my site statistics in my continual battle against referal spam (a battle I have had great success with). I was also looking at my search keyphrases (the things people search for that lead to my site).  The things people are hitting my site with are widely varied, but there are some that make me chuckle wildly. Here is a sampling of my favorites.</p>
<ul>
<li>awesome sideburns</li>
<li>timothy crowe</li>
<li>poulet frit kentucky</li>
<li>very big ass</li>
<li>ibrick</li>
<li>i hate python</li>
<li>red penguins in venice</li>
<li>scary black man</li>
<li>blind squirrel</li>
<li>watersports blog</li>
<li>bile tastes like fish</li>
<li>i hate zope</li>
<li>giant chainsaw</li>
<li>really awesome stuff</li>

<li>retard in a harness</li>
<li>how to use the toilet</li>

</ul>
