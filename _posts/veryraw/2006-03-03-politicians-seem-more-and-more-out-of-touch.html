<p>I have a mean rant on this brewing that I'll drop on you all when the midterm elections come closer, but I really need to say this.  It seems that the politicians in Washington are further and further from what the people they are representing want.  I would rather see an entire year of abortion debate in Congress then see them working on laws that suit no one except big bussiness.  At least a large portion of the population think abortion is an important topic. I read on boing boing today that <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/03/02/house_introduces_man.html">Mike Ferguson of New Jersey has introduced a bill that caters to the RIAA</a> by crippling recording devices.</p>
<p>I sure bet that the residents of New Jersey care more about the impact of recording devices on the bottom lines of the members of the RIAA than about that bullshit healthcare or worthless education.  Lets just chalk this up to the government in general paying less and less attention to what the people want.  Take away all your civil liberties and rights and place to voice your opinion and the people don't matter. I sure was starting to miss feeling disenfranchised by the political process.  It's good to be back in an election year.</p>
<p>If it weren't for bills like the <a href="http://internetweek.cmp.com/181500500?cid=rssfeed_pl_inw">net neutrality bill</a> from Senator Ron Wyden from oregon, I would plum loss faith in the government all together.</p>
