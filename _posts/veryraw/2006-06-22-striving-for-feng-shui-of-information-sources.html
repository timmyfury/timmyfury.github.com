<p>For those of you out there who suffer through your life with <acronym title="Nerd Attention Deficiency Disorder">NADD</acronym>, you are probably all too aware of my struggle to aquire enough information to quench my thirst.  Occasionally I go on binges that would test the patience of the most understanding girlfriend, as I am lost to books and magazines and blogs.</p>
<p>Feng shui is a term used to describe the arrangement of object in your space.  <a href="http://www.answers.com/?tname=feng-shui"><cite>Answers</cite> defines feng shui</a> as <q>The Chinese art or practice of positioning objects, especially graves, buildings, and furniture, based on a belief in patterns of yin and yang and the flow of chi that have positive and negative effects</q>, though in the ever increasing bastardization of language, it can be applied to information as well.  I think of the feng shui of information sources as the reliance on a variety devices and sources for aquiring the information you need to survive.</p>
<p>I wrote before that I'm always searching for <a href="http://veryraw.com/history/2004/11/alternate-information-sources/">alternative information sources</a>.  The key is to vary it and make it worth your while.  I've trimmed my feed reader down to only the important ones.  The blogs or sites that give me the highest quality information.  I keep a few good magazines at the toilet.  I have recently started taking the train to work and I have been reading novels and technical manuals with a fury.</p>
<p>The most important thing though is that you learn how to evaluate the information that you consume.  There is nothing worse than poor information gathering ability.  Information is increasingly easier to gain access to, although, at the same time, it becomes increasingly difficult to find.  Information literacy is quickly becoming one of the most important skills that a person can develop.</p>
