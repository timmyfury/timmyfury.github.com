      I laughed when I read that... but then the second thought hit me.
      
      I don't really get it.

      <p>Here's the original fable.  This is where that commentary came from...</p>
      <blockquote>
      The Scorpion and the Frog
      
      A scorpion and a frog meet on the bank of a stream and the scorpion asks the frog to carry him across on its back. The frog asks, "How do I know you won't sting me?" The scorpion says, "Because if I do, I will die too."
      
      The frog is satisfied, and they set out, but in midstream, the scorpion stings the frog. The frog feels the onset of paralysis and starts to sink, knowing they both will drown, but has just enough time to gasp "Why?" 
      
      Replies the scorpion: "Its my nature..."

    content: So the moral of th story is something like, don't believe everything someone says, or its hard to change or something like that.  Whatever you take from it.  Point being that the Middle East is how it is and will never change.

    content: I've decided that the people of the middle east are angry and discontented due to centuries of women with constantly sandy vaginas. If we could build a campaign to send specialized brushes so these women can finally get the sand out of their vaginas, they will stop driving their husbands mad with second-hand rage, and peace will finally find the middle east. Think about it...

<p>I was listening to <a href="http://www.whyy.org/91FM/RadioTimes.html">Radio Times</a> on WHYY this morning and I heard the funniest analogy about the Middle East.  They were talking about the recent <a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/2005-02-17-voa15.cfm">assination of the former Prime Minister of Lebanon</a> wich is being blamed in Syria.  I forget the name of the guest but here goes.</p>
<blockquote>
A frog and a scorpion are sitting on the banks of a river.  Scorpion says, "Frog, can you swim me across the river?" Frog says, "No! you'll sting me!" To which scorpion replies, "I wouldn't do that, if I were to sting you we would both drown."  So as they are crossing the river, scorpion stings frog. As they are sinking into the river frog asks, "Why did you sting me?" "Because its the Middle East," replies scorpion.
