<p>I've been following the Democratic presidential primary relatively closely this year.  It's sort of important considering the winner of that race will be the only chance we have of removing a man from office who last week I heard say, "The Israeli's must do everything in their power to defend themselves against suiciders."  Yes you read right suiciders.  Regardless, I was elated when Wesley Clark joined the race.  His politics are relatively unscathed and his opinions match mine about as closely as one could hope.  And in my opinion he's already won the race just because all the other candidates have started ripping him.  As for the other candidates"; well let's just have the inauguration for Bush right now so he can finish fucking the world's ass and we don't have to deal with an entire year of mudslinging and bullshit promises (which I must say anyone who thinks that the things that are said in a campaign should actually be counted on are fucking drunk).</p>
<p>Howard Dean, the former front runner reminds me of a mix between Al Gore and Deputy Dog.</p>
<p>Clark, Dean and Lieberman are the only three that have a chance so they are the only three that I really pay attention to.  I must say though that Al Sharpton hasn't a chance.  He's a Reverend and an idiot.  But if he could get like 75% of the black population to vote He may actually win.  Fat chance though.  In the <a href="http://www.census.gov/prod/3/98pubs/p20-504.pdf">1996 Election only 50.6% of the black population voted.</a>  Good luck with the primary.  Ambassador Carol Moseley Braun has good politics and she's very intelligent and I firmly believe that she would have the country's best interests in mind.  Here's the thing though; black and female.</p>
