Going to the market is a relatively new concept for me.  I'm not talking about stopping in for a few items.  I mean the weekly food shopping.  The make a list of things you need kind of shopping.  Trish and I shop at two places every week.  Gentile's for produce, Giant for the rest.  They are high quality low cost and we like the way they are arranged.  Regardless, something we have noticed is the level of danger is extremely high.  I am a relatively sentient person.  I know whats going on most of the time and I think I adjust well to my surroundings.  The market is a whole nothing planet though.  There's less action at Roosevelt Boulevard and Red Lion Road.  These freaking ladies are freaking crazy.  They have no concept of what's going on around them.  And they pay attention to one thing - fresh lettuce.  They will run you down without a second though if you are in front of the eggs. Beware of these maniacs if you happen to find yourself making a trip to the market.
