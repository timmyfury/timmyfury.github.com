    content: "Just a quick correction here, the reason the term software developer is used when describing a job like mine is because i never code in any specific language exclusively. Its all a deadly mish mosh of horrible languages vomiting all over eachother like in the days of imperial rome. "

      Every time I hear "computer guy," now, I think of this post. It just recently happened that our server hard drive fried, at work - and now everyone is talking about how the "computer guy" is trying to retain the lost data.
      
      I just cringe every time I hear the phrase.

<p>Stop saying that.  It's 2005, not 1994. For god's sake, its the internet. Oh, and while I'm at it stop saying "computer guy."  I don't walk into a hospital and call everyone working there the "body guy" do I?  There's a big difference between my job and Mark's job and Burn's job and Don's job.  I am a web developer, Burn is a <del>java developer</del> software developer, Mark is a <del>systems admin</del> systems admin and Don is a <del>Network admin</del>  multi-system administrator / technology integrator / slavelaborer / project manager.  There's a difference and none of them are simple enough to be broken down to "computer guy."  If you can't understand the differences, sign off of AOL, unplug your computer and return it to Walmart.  </p>
