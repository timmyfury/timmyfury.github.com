<p><strong>the query</strong></p>
<p>I was at Trish's one morning reading the back of a box of <a href="http://www.cheerios.com/about/berryburst.asp">Cheerios Berry Burst</a> with Strawberries and Bananas and there was a fact that I found relatively amazing.</p>
<blockquote>The average American eats about 28 pounds of bananas per years</blockquote>
<p>Good lord man! 28 pounds is a huge amount of bananas. I couldn't get over it. "Thats too much," I say. So after about a week of babbling endlessly about how I couldn't get over how much 28 pounds of bananas was, I decided to take the scientific approach. So follow with me now. I will try to do this in a logical order.</p>
<p><strong>the methods</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Bananas at <a href="http://www.wawa.com/">WAWA</a> cost 79 cents a pound.</li>
<li>For five days I bought a banana at WAWA. The prices of these bananas 28 cents, 24 cents, 26 cents, 29 cents and 24 cents. For an average of 26.2 cents per banana</li>
<li>Therefore I conclude that one banana is approxiamately a third of a pound.  (79 cents divided by 3 bananas equals 26.3333 cents per banana.)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>the findings</strong></p>
<p>My findings were surprising. At 3 bananas per pound, you would only have to eat 84 bananas in one year.  Thats only 1 banana every 4.34 days or 1.6 bananas per week.  Thats only 7 bananas per month.  Thats amazing.</p>
<p>In fact, if you are a 1 banana a day person, in other words you eat 365 bananas per year, you don't consume 28 pounds of bananas per year.  You consume 121.6 pounds of bananas per year.  Dear lord.</p>
