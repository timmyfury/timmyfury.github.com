    content: I've been meaning to read this book at some point. I read an actual journal of a Geisha once, which had the same effect of changing my view of Geisha, but truth be told the author wasn't the brightest bulb in the back and the story did not have very much political or historical significance. She talked a lot more about how she was the best Geisha ever and blah blah blah and also about how the Geisha tradition is changing and dying.

<p>I just finished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0375400117/qid=1114579690/sr=8-2/ref=pd_csp_2/002-0835285-8996851?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Memoirs of a Geisha</a>.  It's good.  It's really good.  I had a hard time putting it down.  I don't read alot of fiction, but I've taken several things from this book that should be noted.  The first few are strictly on a nerdy, I learned something so it wasn't a complete waste, level.  The book goes into great detail about the life of a geisha.  The rituals and the customs.  If you had asked me before I read the book to play word association and you said "geisha," I would have replied, "prostitute."  How wrong I would have been.  Arthur Golden's extensive research into the world of geisha is apparent and more than succeeded in destroying any preconceived notions I may have had.  Furthermore, it was a look into a culture that generally remains closed. </p>
<p>The second thing that I took from the book was its look at the everyday life of the Japanese during World War 2.  The fact that the entire people were not gung ho intot he war and that they were forced to be so should be known.  It carries weight now for Americans.  Not all of us like the war we are fighting or the policy we are preaching.  I hope that the rest of the world sees this.  It's also poignant now in  Japan, where the Chinese are pissed about the glossing over of war discretions in Japanese textbooks.  <a href="http://veryraw.com/history/2005/04/in-history-class/">I'm not saying that its okay to ignore those things</a>. What I am saying is that its important that the Chinese (in the textbook example) and the world as a whole (in the US example) realize that the entire country isn't neccesarily on the same page.</p>
<h3>The book impacted me further though...</h3>
<p>Sayuri, the main character, goes through several traumatic moments in her life and comes out all the better in the end.  The focus though is that with every change she never gives up. She keeps going.  The way she deals with death and loss and setbacks is stoic.  She lets go of things quickly. This allows her to pick up and go on.
</p><p>"Memoirs of a Geisha" emphasizes that change is inevitable.  I feel like the book was enforcing the idea that you have to be able to bounce back.  You have to deal with change, confront it and try not to avoid it, try not to lose yourself in it.</p>
