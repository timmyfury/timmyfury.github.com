      i love it..."collingdale christmas"!  i'm going to post it just that way every week on http://groups.yahoo.com/group/DelcoPAFreecycle/.  
      
      don't go pseudointellectual on me, you seem like a smart kid (good point about political fear and schmear).  the important thing is to consume/throw away less as planet is being buried under big pile of USA refuse.  if some people can take what others have given up on and genuinely reuse or earn some cash recycling, good on them.

<p>It is now 10:33pm. All is quiet in Collingdale. Everyone is in bed in my house and here I sit, procrastinating when I should be doing stat homework. The cat mills around my room looking for something to entertain himself with. A train whistle wails in the distance. Huh? What could that rattling-banging-breaking noise outside be? I believe Jim Bob and Clara Sue are back for their third trip on this street. It's like a goldmine.</p>
<p>My brother fondly calls it "Collingdale Christmas." Yes children it's that time of year again. Bulk trash pickup is here again. The day of bulk trash pick up isn't the fun part. The extra fun time is the evening and the night before.</p>
<p>All evening people have been cruising the 6th precinct looking through each others big rubbish and hauling it to their houses to become there own big rubbish. It's entertaining really. It's really the only time of the year that you can watch all the hicks in your town fight over each others trash.</p>
<p>Collingdale Christmas, damn that's funny.</p>
