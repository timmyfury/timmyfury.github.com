<p>I saw this album in the stores a few weeks ago and thought the cover was intriguing.  I wrote down the web address with the intent of checking it out.  Never did.  So the other day I picked up a copy of Details magazine and in the back read a review of <a href="http://www.kerenann.com/">Keren Ann</a>. Something peaked my interest...</p>
<blockquote>The lyrics feature enough stalkers, dysfunctional lovers, and grizzled freaks to populate a fistful of Tom Waits albums.</blockquote>
<p>If you have read my site for a while you know I am a huge Tom Waits fan.  I know most of his later stuff and enjoy almost all of it.  It's some sorrow filled shit.  So I'm all, "Pffffft, they ain't no way that this shit could be as sad as Tom Waits."  So I buy the album.</p>
<p>I was listening to it today at work and started feeling so sullen and surly that I could have downed an entire bottle of Old Crow.  Damn, this shit is good.</p>
<p>The sound of her voice is soothing and whispery.  The lyrics are haunting.  The album will make you happy and sad at the same time.  Its amazing.  The album is sung partly in French (I love the French language).</p>
<p>Buy this album or message me and we'll "talk about it further".</p>
