As mentioned before in my entry about the amazing <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2005/07/24/sports/20050724_LANCE_SLIDESHOW_1.html">Lance Armstrong</a>, I have been riding my bike. Since I moved to Media I have been getting out more to ride.  Using this great Google maps application called <a href="http://www.sueandpaul.com/gmapPedometer/">GMaps Pedometer</a> I can track my ride turn for turn and see how far I have traveled. I was just saving the links on del.icio.us but I decided last night to screenshot them and upload them to flickr where I can make notes and comments about the course I rode as well as dates and important areas to remember when mapping out future routes to take on my rides.  Anyway for those who are interested you can take a look at my maps.  They are in my <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/timmyfury/sets/653066/">Bike Routes set</a>.
