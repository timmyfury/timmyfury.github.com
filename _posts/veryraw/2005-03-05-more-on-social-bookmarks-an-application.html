      Those are some very good ideas, for delicous applications...
      
      Can you tell me how you got your delicious bookmarks to appear on your blog?
      
      I am thinking about implementing this on my site, and I am not sure how to do that yet.

      Try this link.  It gives you a few links  install instructions for the wordpress plugin.  It was relatively easy but took a bit of moving and manipulating.  Shell access is nearly a must.  Good luck.

So after flaming <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> when I told him about it <a href="http://iam.thecolossus.net/?p=47">Mark admitting he was wrong</a> about it all along.  In fact, he found a use for it.  He's using it to help himself build a modular synth.  His application is interesting but for me lacks a personal, real world application.  Other than for retaining resources and links to stuff that I may want to come back to later, my primary use has been the link feed on the side.  A way to share the sort of information I am consuming.

I have another application 

When applied to research this has great applications.  I just finished a presentation for my MIS class.  I have 10 white papers, 5 vendors, 35 news articles and 3 journal articles about the topic.  <a href="http://del.icio.us/timmyfury/rfid">I save them all in del.icio.us and later I can see what I have saved</a>.  Giving them similar tags and describing them a bit I can sort through my sources later.  As you widdle down your sources you can delete them from your list.  If you find the particular part or information you want to use in each document you can add that as the extended description.

Furthermore, this could also be applied to abstracts for books that you want to find later.  coupled with <http ://scholar.google.com">Google Scholar, this becomes a mean tool in the beginning stages of research.  The stage where you just harvest large amounts of information for later combing (this assumes that everyone researches the same way as I do). 
 
Later when you have finished your paper and you are citing your works, you have a conveniant list of all of your sources and some bits about how and where they were used.</http>
