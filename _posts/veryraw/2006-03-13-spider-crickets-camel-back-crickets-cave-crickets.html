<p>Whatever you call them they are bloody terrifying. I wrote about these terrifying <a href="http://veryraw.com/history/2005/01/spiders-crickets-lions/">cricket pests</a> in January of 2005 and had an overwhelming response, 69 comments over   the course of the next year. The response was all accross the country, with   commenters hailing from northwest Arkansas, South and North Carolina, Virginia   Beach and Norfolk, Virginia, Cincinnati, Ohio, Oklahoma (where they call them   sprickets), Missouri, California, Long Island, Texas, Winfield, West Virginia.   I felt this was enough of a response that it was neccesary to do some research   to help those who visit rid themselves of these terrifying animals.</p>

<h3>Sweet Jesus, what are those things!</h3>

<p>Cave Crickets are unmistakable. These crickets are a tan color with dark stripes.   Unlike other crickets, cave crickets are wingless, but have more powerful, long   legs that give them amazing jumping capability. They are also chirpless; a silent   terror. These crickets will eat nearly anything, which explains why   <a href="http://veryraw.com/history/2005/01/spiders-crickets-lions/#comment-1388">Joy's   friend has seen them eating her cat's poop.</a> Furthermore, as   <a href="http://veryraw.com/history/2005/01/spiders-crickets-lions/#comment-1416">Thomas</a>   and <a href="http://veryraw.com/history/2005/01/spiders-crickets-lions/#comment-1431">Glen</a>   pointed out the are not just summer/spring creatures, they can weather the cold   too. Though, the largest amount of hits to my site in search of information   about cave crickets has come in the spring of 2005 and 2006.</p>
<p>These buggers are nocturnal and aren't attracted to light. They use their long   antennea to feel through dark spaces and they generally live in <strong>actual   caves</strong>. Though, as you would find if you read through the comments on   my entry about these crickets, they are found nearly everywhere; basements,   crawl spaces, washing machines, condos and apartments. These are however not idea   situations for these creatures to be in.  Wikipedia points out...</p>  
  <blockquote title="Cave cricket - From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia" cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_Cricket">
	<p>While they have been known to take up residence the basements of buildings, 
	  many cave crickets live out their entire lives deep inside actual caves. In 
	  those habitats they sometimes face long spans of time with insufficient access 
	  to nutrients. To avoid starvation, they have been known to devour their own 
	  extremities, even though they cannot regenerate limbs.</p>
	</blockquote>
<p>It is important to note that these crickets do not bite.  They aren't harmful to babies and they don't attack 	you when you come near. It sometimes seems as though the jump toward you, but they are merely trying to escape 	the fate of a million roaches. In September of 2005 Steven J. Taylor led a team from University of Illinois at 	Urbana-Champaign and reported that cave crickets left there homes at night and traveled up to 260+ feet from their	home in search of food.</p>
<blockquote title="When cave crickets go out for dinner, they really go, researchers say" cite="http://www.news.uiuc.edu/NEWS/05/0907crickets.html">
	<p>Previous research indicated that most crickets stay within 50 meters (164 
	  feet) from their caves. As part of the formula for a buffer zone proposed by 
	  the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, a range for cricket foraging was recommended. 
	  The buffer zone also extends outward to control for the effects of invasive 
	  red imported fire ants (Solenopsis invicta Buren). The buffer-zone formula helps 
	  to guide where to apply treatment applications against the ants.</p>
	<p>Buffer zones are designed to help maintain a healthy vegetative community, 
	  including woodland and grassland species, around cave entrances to protect cave 
	  life from disturbance, including that created by encroaching urban development.</p>
	<p>On average, adult crickets were found farther from the cave entrance than 
	  were the nymphs. While 51 percent of all crickets were found to be within 40 
	  meters (131 feet) of the cave entrance, 8 percent were found at locations 80 
	  meters (262 feet) and beyond.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This finding is important when you are considering your actions in ridding yourself of these pests. They are searching for food to bring back to their   home. Their intension is not to bother. In suburban areas, their homes have   been encroached upon and in most areas, 260 feet makes up several pieces of   property. This makes it even easier for cave crickets to end up in your basement or crawl space.</p>

<h3>How can I get rid of them?</h3>

<p>Is it a mole or a camel..........? recently mentioned in a newsletter about 
  pest control from as a problem on a golf course in the area as well.<br />

<p>I am just very anti-pesticide. Cave crickets aren&#8217;t indoor breeders though. 
  Spraying the area that you see them in is not very effective because they are 
  generally solitary and only wander into your house by accident. Everything I 
  have read to date on them suggests that you eliminate cool dark areas. <a href="http://www.ipm.iastate.edu/ipm/iiin/ccamelcr.html" rel="nofollow">Eliminating 
  hiding and breeding places</a> around your house and moreover in your yard will 
  help to prevent them from sneaking into your house. </p>

  Having a dehumidifier in our garage seems to help. I think we need to seal more 
  areas around windows and our garage door. I am going to try to figure out how 
  to keep our basement as dry as possible and make it less &#8220;cave-like&#8221;. 
  Also, since I can&#8217;t stand them, I am just going to stay out of our basement 
  at night if I can help it - they seem worse then. </p>

  <p><strong>find out where this information came from</strong></p>
<p><em>First, discover where the crickets are getting inside and stop up the holes. 
  If that fails to keep them out, the Canadian version of the U.S. Environmental 
  Protection Agency suggests mixing some molasses and vanilla extract or lemon 
  juice in water. Crickets are lured to this bait and drown in it. A flyswatter 
  works very nicely, too.</em></p>

			<p>We&#8217;ve had camelback crickets for about 15 years. It&#8217;s a good bet they are breeding in a woodpile that&#8217;s too near our house.<br />
But I don&#8217;t have another place to put the woodpile.  Some of these buggers get in the house. In particular they come inside in the fall.  I&#8217;ve applied Sevin dust around the woodpile (it&#8217;s in a shelter and does not get wet). Also, I go out at night and kill individual crickets with Raid or something similar. This keeps the population down. </p>

<p>On another site I just noticed two more ideas. (1) Use glue boards inside the house in dark cave-like places. Glue boards are just cardboard with a very sticky glue. This should get rid of individual crickets that stray into the house. (2) Sprinkle Borax dust near where they are breeding. Good idea!!! This is a little known idea. Borax dust kills cockroaches and a lot of other pests. As some have said, &#8220;it cuts the bugs like glass cuts humans&#8221;. It really does. They lose fluids through the cuts and dehydrate and die. I&#8217;m going to apply Borax powder right after I finish this note. I&#8217;ve used it for other pests, and feel sort of stupid because I didn&#8217;t think of it sooner.</p>

<p>A by-the-way&#8230; you can make ant poison (sweet eating ants only) by blending Borax powder into Karo syrup. Add Borax and stir and do this until the mixture is saturated. Borax is CHEAP&#8230; a lot cheaper than the usual pesticides.

			<p>On October 3 I posted a message concerning our camelback cricket problem.  All experts say the trick is to kill them outside the house. Apparently the ones that come inside just wander in through cracks. Kill them outside the the problem is gone.</p>
<p>So we sprinkled Borax (Boric Acid) powder around our woodpile.<br />
That&#8217;s where they seem to be hatching. It&#8217;s under a shelter, dry, and near the house. Borax (sold as a roach killer) will kill most crawling insects.  I bought a large container of Borax (advertised as a roach killer) at a dollar store for $2.00 and sprinkled it generously around the woodpile in a band about 12 inches wide.  Then I sprinkled some flakes of dry oatmeal on top of the Borax to give the buggers something to eat and a reason to walk in the Borax. Contact with the Borax kills them&#8230; they do not have to eat it. There are now dead camelback crickets around the woodpile. I check every night after dark and the live cricket count is zero.  Before doing this treatment those critters were having a party out there every night.  We&#8217;ve had no camelbacks in our home for about three weeks. None!!</p>

<p>After 15 years of putting up with these things we seem to have a solution. And it&#8217;s a cheap solution, too.</p>
<p>Of course if you put the Borax in places were it will be wet from rain, this may not work at all.</p>
<p>Another thing we did was to sprinkle Borax on the threshold of basement doors that we seldom open. We have been convinced this is the place they have been coming inside.  There are now dead sowbugs and other dead creepy-crawly things on the thresholds along with the corpses of a few camelback crickets.</p>
<p>This turned out to be easier than we thought. We&#8217;ve used Borax (Boric Acid) to kill roaches but until recently never thought about using it to kill camelback crickets.
