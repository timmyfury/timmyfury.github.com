<p>The information you are about to receive is not for the weak of heart or those who care not about colonic health.  I offer this information simply because I was amazed myself. It may or may not be healthy, you be the judge.</p>
<p>Yesterday, upon waking I ate a measured cup of <a href="http://www.kashi.com/golean_cereal.aspx?SID=1&Category_ID=48&Link_ID=27&">Kashi GoLean</a> <em>(10g)</em> and a <a href="http://www.nutritiondata.com/facts-001-02s01fa.html">banana</a> <em>(3g)</em>.  I went to class, on the way to work I had an <a href="http://www.nutritiondata.com/facts-001-02s01e9.html">apple</a> <em>(3g)</em>.  At lunchtime I had a turkey and cheese on <a href="http://www.nutritiondata.com/facts-001-02s03rg.html">wheat</a> sandwich <em>(4g)</em>. <a href="http://www.nutritiondata.com/facts-001-02s0453.html">Pretzels</a> <em>(2g)</em> a yogurt with a combination of <a href="http://www.nutritiondata.com/facts-001-02s01l1.html">rasberries</a> and <a href="http://www.nutritiondata.com/facts-001-02s01ff.html">blueberries</a> <em>(3g)</em>. An <a href="http://www.nutritiondata.com/facts-001-02s01in.html">orange</a> <em>(3g)</em> as a midafternoon snack.</p>
<p>To this point we are at a very healthy 28 grams of fiber.  But we haven't covered dinner yet.</p>
<p>I had a salad with two <a href="http://www.nutritiondata.com/facts-001-02s02a3.html">tomatoes</a> <em>(2g)</em>, two stalks of <a href="http://www.nutritiondata.com/facts-001-02s01uk.html">celery</a> <em>(2g)</em> and <a href="http://www.nutritiondata.com/facts-001-02s028g.html">red pepper</a> <em>(2g)</em>.  There was more in the salad but that was all that was there with significant fiber content.</p>
<p>None of this is quite rediculous though.  34 grams of fiber in a day is alot but healthy.  The kicker is the main course though.  We made fajitas.  I had two.  Nothing in them of fibrous consequence right? Right.  But the whole wheat tortillas we made the fajitas with weighed in at a whopping 21grams of fiber a piece.  And I had two.</p>
<p>That's 76 grams of fiber for the day.  Needless to say, everything is moving along smoothly today.</p>
