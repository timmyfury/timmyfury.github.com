<p>I heard the greatest quote on NPR last night on my drive home.  "In most cases, when I murdered these women, I did not know their names. Most of the time, I killed them the first time I met them. I do not have a good memory for their faces. I killed so many women; I have a hard time keeping them straight."  This is Gary Leon Ridgeway, the Green River Killer.  Fucking amazing.  He looks like a fucking psycho.  His neighbors were like, "He seemed so normal."  My fucking ass.  If you look at the guy you can see he's not normal and if you say that's normal then, you've got a really skewed sense of normal.  Here's a new state motto for Washington, Washington State: <a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=Gary+Ridgway">Where this is normal</a>.</p>
<p>I am thinking about joining some sort of organization that encourages voting.  Bush needs to be removed from office next year.  It's important.  He just signed into law a bill that makes partial birth abortion illegal.  I think that's fucked up.  Honestly it's not even a matter of pro-life or pro-choice.  There are so many other issues wrapped up in that one law.  First and foremost is the right to choose.  I mean I'm all for keeping it in your pants or wearing protection but these are the same conservative retards that oppose condom distribution in schools.  I'm not saying that I think abortion is right, I'm just saying that you should have the choice of whether or not to ruin your life.</p>
<p>In addition, When Bush signed the bill the other day, his statement was, "For years, a terrible form of violence has been directed against children who are inches from birth while the law looked the other way, today at last the American people and our government have confronted the violence and come to the defense of the innocent child"; This right to life cannot be granted or denied by government, because it does not come from government -- it comes from the creator of life."  You fucking oil sniffing terrorist.  You have gone so far right that you have fallen off the plane.  The creator of life?  Yes.  The creator of life.  The mother and father happen to hold that title last time I checked.  And second of all you are fucking contradicting yourself.  You just signed a bill that does give life. Then you say it can't be granted by government?</p>
