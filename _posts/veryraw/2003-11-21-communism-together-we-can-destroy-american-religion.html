<p>The United States. Trillions of dollars in the national defense budget. One   hundred and thirty thousand troops in the middle east. Missiles that can burrow   deep into the ground and through layers upon layers of concrete before exploding.   30 million dollar helicopters and the most technilogically advanced tanks in   the world. Billions of dollars on strategy. And the most highly trained fighting   force in the world. You know how they get us in the last terrorist attack in Turkey? Donkey carts.</p>
<p>There is a raging debate right now over the homosexual marriage issue. The   things that makes me laugh most about this is when I here some retard right   say something to the effect of, "It destroyed the sanctity of marriage."   There is no such thing as sanctity in marriage anymore. People lie and cheat.   Beatings. I was talking to this guy the other day at work and he said, "Well,   I have to go Wife sit now." WHAT? When you start to think of seeing your   wife as a problem, it's time to go. There is a huge divorce rate. People split   up at the drop of a hat. Straights have fucked up marriage so badly that half   the time I don't even know why people are together. How about the girls that   force marriage on their boyfriends. The guy only talks about it in the first place cause they are afraid of getting cut off. I know a guy who I am convinced only got married so his "wife" would have sex with him. What a fucking dummy. Sanctity of marriage my fucking ass. At least homosexuals will add some flair to marriage again. Continue to do things together. Maybe still fuck each other now and then, instead of using sex as a weapon. Instead of getting comfortable with each other, AKA fattening up. An issue like this is why it's important   that the Democrats keep Bush from nominating Supreme Court justices. If he gets his far right douchebags on the bench we will suffer severely. Another reason we need to get Bush out of office. To quote <a href="http://www.theonion.com/3945/wdyt.html">The Onion</a>, "It makes sense for Bush to pull out. If his own father had exercised the judgment to pull out, the U.S. wouldn't have been there in the first place."</p>
