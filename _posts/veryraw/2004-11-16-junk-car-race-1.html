    content: Maybe next time <i>you</i> can drive. Demo derbies are shitloads of fun. I remember going to some  when I was a kid. Anything located at a dirt track is always interesting, and great freak, I mean people, watching.

    content: Dan, I would contact <a href="http://www.pagodamotorcycleclub.com/" rel="nofollow">Pagoda Motorcycle Club</a>.  I don't know much more about the race.    They should be able to help you though.

<p>On Sunday, Trish, Mark Geoff and I took a ride out to Birdsboro, PA for the <a href="http://www.pagodamotorcycleclub.com/">Pagoda Motorcycle Club</a> Junk Car Race to watch my old blue Crown Victoria get beat on.  It was a really good time and we sure learned a thing or two about rural America.  I thought the car would get destroyed but it didn't do bad at all.  Ends up that Kim and Jason are going to use the car again next year.  Awesome.</p>
<p>This is going to be a two part post.  This one has all the digital images that Trish took while I shot with film.  I have to wait for the film to be developed and then I have to scan them.  Chances are you won't get those images for a while.  These are Trish's touched up a bit in photoshop by me.</p>
<p>These images have all been moved into a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/timmyfury/sets/198016/">flickr set</a>.</p>
