<p>I had thought I had thrown out as much as I could before I made <a href="http://veryraw.com/history/2005/07/looks-like-i-have-an-apartment/">my recent move</a>.  I spent hours upon hours throwing away every little thing I could think of throwing out.  But after the actual move, quickly realized that I hadn't thrown out nearly as much as I previously thought.  The day after we finished moving in we filled the dumpster in our parking lot with boxes and old crap that I didn't even realize that I owned.  Taking a quick glance around the apartment as I write this and I see even more crap that I could ditch but just haven't.  Then there are the four boxes of stuff that are just being stored at my mother's house.  They are things that I don't use and probably never will but can't bring myself to throw away yet.</p>
<p>So here is my point.  If you are moving, throw <strong>everything</strong> away.  If you haven't used it in the last six months (maybe less), throw it away.  You don't need it and after about 2 weeks you won't remember that you ever had it.  None of those possesions are really needed and you will feel better when you don't have as much stuff.  When everything you own is visible to you all the time, and nothing is stored away in boxes somewhere you will feel better.  Like a load has been lifted from your shoulders. Not to mention your moving will be easier and you won't need to find a bigger place everytime you move out of your current place.</p>
