<p>Using aerial photos, officials have found a 400 foot waterfall in California.  I should say they didn't just find it.  They had apparently found it then lost it, then found it again.  As I read <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8927720/">the article on MSNBC</a> I thought to myself, How the hell do you lose a 400 foot waterfall.   Then, on further inspection of this <a href="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/object/article?f=/c/a/2005/07/24/BAGMVDSP311.DTL&o=2&type=travelbayarea>map from SF Gate</a>, and this <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/08/0815_050815_waterfall.html">article from National Geographic</a>, I realized how.</p>
<p>The waterfall is called <strong>Whiskeytown Falls</strong>, located in <strong>Whiskeytown National Recreation Area</strong>.  Hmmm... I wonder.</p>
