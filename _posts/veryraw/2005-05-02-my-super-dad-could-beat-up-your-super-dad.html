      Well if i were to go with traditional powers i would say invisibility and either flight or some sort of ghostly form where i could pass through things. \r\n\
      \r\n\
      But if i could only choose non-traditional powers i would choose the ability to be inflated via any means of traditional air inflation once squashed. This would come with the ability to make accordian sounds whilst flattened. Also the resource to call and order whatever i wanted, no matter how crazy or esoteric, delivered without paying, invariably in a giant crate.   "

      Spit acidic venom. Breath flames. Be able to do both simultaneously to make some sort of biological napalm. I think being able to cloak myself in shadows would be a pretty good visual add to the whole venom thing.

      I'd choose the ability of Teleportation.  So that when I'm in Philly and want to see a friend from San Juan or where ever else in the world, it wouldn't cost me anything and I could do it right then, the same as walking next door to chat.  
      
      Of course I would need this teleportation power to extend to things that are either on my body (like clothes) or things that I am holding on to (like a book or something).

<p>To follow up that entry which was horribly boring, I would like to offer a peace offering.</p>
<p>If you could have any super power, what would it be?  Here are mine.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Background music and sound effects</strong> - No matter what I was doing everyone would hear music that matched the mood and sound effects that made everything I did more emphatic.  No one would be able to react to them (ie dancing or looking around trying to figure out where it was coming from) it would just be there.  Only for me.</li>
<li><strong>Spit bees</strong> - I would open my mouth and bees would fly out with the pressure of a fire hose.  I would be immune but everyone would be subjected to the horror of my mouth bees.</li>
</ul>
<p>What are yours?</p>
