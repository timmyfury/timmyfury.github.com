    content: "I have read books on the computer in pdf form and am even coming to prefer it. As far as a crisp paper and a cup of coffee goes, i would prefer a laptop and a cup of coffee much more. Don't give geoff false hope, <a href=\"//www.expresscomputeronline.com/20041122/technology01.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">Soon even newspapers will be paperless</a>.he should go back to the apothecary and sell leeches, thats where the real money is.

    content: Your point is well accepted Burn but the fact still remains that the time it takes for people to embrace new technology is astounding.  In 2005, we still have professors at the college who refuse to use email to communicate with students.

      E-media has allready proven itself cheap, faster than print in distribution, durable and portable.  Now, in order to lay in the death blow to print, it needs to stop imitating print content and create something better.  For instance, I don't choose XM radio over FM because I can listen to the same channel anywhere in teh country... although that is nice... I choose XM because it has stand up comedy channels... access to content I can't get any other way.  
      
      Repackaging shit in a better package than your competitor will only help your sales for so long.  Eventually, economics will take over and you'll fail to be competative unless you can make better shit or chose to package something better.

Amazing how Burn led directly into the point I wanted to make in part 2.  Burn happens to be one of the most internet savvy people I know.  Like myself he probably uses the internet for most things.  Most of my friends do.  But with as much information as I have, I also have a very closed word view.  My friends are people who have, use and love technology.  I read the blogs about and by people who have, use and love technology.  I work in an environment which is soaked in, uses and loves technology.  There's a big world out there of people who do not embrace it like I or Burn do.  

Recently I was talking to my very internet savvy sister about flickr.  I was trying to tell her about the benefits of it.  Outside of the whole sharing and viewing other people's pictures, what happens to your images when your harddrive blows up.  My god the horror.  If you use flickr you are backed up.  And your information is cataloged and dated and explained.  No dice.  She says, "I'd still keep it local too."  This is a bit far from the original subject, but my point is that its difficult to get people to change the way they do things.  

I am certainly not trying to say that Geoff is in the wrong career.  His career choice is no worse than mine.  When I say "The future is grim for print," I am talking in the longterm 80 years from now sense.  When you still hear in the news that the internet is an amazing "new" technology, you can be sure that the greatest portion of the country (world) is still on the "haven't touched it" end of the spectrum.  I may have given up on newspapers, but its more for a lack of time.  I must admit that there's something sensorially pleasing about a crisp newspaper and a cup of coffee.  Furthermore, its gonna be a long time before I can fathom reading a book on the computer.  

<a href="http://veryraw.com/history/2005/05/the-future-is-grim-for-print-part-1/">I gave the salesman a hard time</a> mostly because its fun.  I think that news organizations need to evaluate the way they use the internet for their product delivery, but I don't think that the internet will replace printed newspapers anytime within the next 100 years.
