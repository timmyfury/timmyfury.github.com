<p>The Friday before Trish left I met her at West Chester for lunch while she was on break from her class.  When she went back to class I had about 4 hours to kill until she was done class so we could go out to dinner.  I shot down 202 South to go to the mall and snag a pair of jeans.  It took me forever to get from West Chester to Route one on 202 South.  It's about a 6 minute drive; It took about 25 mintues.  Luckily though I was alright with this due to the fact that when it comes to large trucks and trains and construction equipment I have the mentality of a five year old.  I was stuck behind this crane and another related truck.  It took up nearly two lanes.  I got a picture as I passed when they went to turn onto Route one.</p>
