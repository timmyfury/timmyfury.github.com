    content: You should look into an author named Guy Gavriel Kay. He's written several books that combine historical fiction with fantasy. "The Lions of Al-Rassan" is loosely based on reconquista Spain; "The Sarantine Mosaic" is a duology set in 6th century Byzantium; "The Last Light of the Sun" evokes Viking, Anglo-Saxon and Celtic cultures (this one is less strict with historical facts). These novels are a great way to combine your two passions - nerdiness and dorkiness! Plus the covers aren't all Dragon-Lance-cheesy :)

<p>I just finished this book called <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/038551641X">The Afghan Campaign</a></em>.  It's classified as "historical literature".  It's based on fact but is still mostly invented story.  After reading <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375725601">The Devil in the White City: Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair that Changed America</a></em> and <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0679745580">In Cold Blood</a></em> nearly back to back, I was hot for historical literature.  I was also looking for something that was epic in scale and would give me a good manly rise from the thought of conquest</p>
<p><em>The Afghan Campaign</em> is about Alexader the Great's conquest of Afghanistan around 330 B.C.  It follows the experiences of a single soldier and the trials and tribulations which he goes through over the course of the expedition.  It was a good read.  It provided great incite to the history of the Afghan people and their customs and ways of thinking which for the most part (basing my comparison mostly on the what I learned about the Afghan people while reading <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594480001">The Kite Runner</a></em>) has not changed much since.</p>
<p>The book really tried very hard to be this great epic.  It was so close too.  I was totally rooting for it and I was totally into the book. I liked the story and I liked the characters.  When I finished though, I realized that it fell just short of my expectations.</p>
<p>So there I was, left hanging, still thirsting for the epic tale that I had expected.  I needed to be quenched.  There was only one appropriate thing to do. So i decided to reread the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0786926813">Dragonlance Chronicles</a> Trilogy.  I read them before, but I stopped after the trilogy.  There is another trilogy that follows, then the story is continued in later books.  I'm going to read them all.  I loved the books the first time I read them and I have cruised through 100 pages in 3 train trips from home to work.</p>
<p>As much as I love these though, I am apparently having an internal struggle with my inner nerd.  I find myself unconsciencely covering any parts of the book that would tell anyone I am reading a Dungeons & Dragons based novel.  As if someone would actually notice. But as Mark said, "That's fair, though in truth you don't need to. Plus they can't make any of the loser jokes and you can always bust out the bestseller status on them."  Too true Mark and besides, if anyone actually knows what they are, there's a good chance they are having the same internal struggle.</p>
