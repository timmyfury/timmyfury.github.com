<p>So here I am... again. It's Wednesday and I think I am going to do my updates every Wednesday. Makes it easier for everyone. Classes have started again. Whoopy.  I can smell the excitement. Most of my classes this semester are actually interesting though which is a plus. In addition, I got a promotion at Camp-in this year. I am now a manager. It's a scary concept.</p>
<p>Timmyfury.com will soon be returning to full functionality. I am working on that now that I have finished up weirdhead.org. Over the course of the next week things will come back on-line. I switched host companies recently because the old company (which shall remain nameless) couldn't support some of the things that I wanted to do. So I have switched to <a href="http://www.nomonthlyfees.com/">NoMonthlyFees.com</a>. They are super good and pretty cheap. Furthermore, unlike Dreamhost which I won't even grace with a link, they are running a full functioning version of PHP. All of the old content from before I switched hosts is gone though cause I lost the SQL files that had the information in them. So we are starting fresh. If you didn't notice at the bottom of each one of my entries now there is a link to make comments about what I write here and you can also read other peoples comments. This is different from the graffiti board and in my opinion way better cause now when you comment on something I write and people read it it will actually make sense.</p>
<p>For all those who don't know, Code is in Qatar. This is his third time in the Middle East. He emailed me once then I reset my email account and deleted the email by accident. So I don't have it to put up here. I'll ask Crissy and post it in case anyone wants to write him. Brain Mac dropped me a link from <a href="http://www.8bm.com/ncm/2003/061103.htm">a soldier in Iraq</a>. Really funny. Makes me proud to know that the guys who are protecting my freedom are assholes just like me.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.stevenwright.com/index.shtml">Steven Wright</a> once said,  "If Jesus loves me, why doesn't he ever call." I have always though this was really funny. Which is why I should share <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/ptech/01/19/offbeat.finland.jesus.reut/index.html">this article on CNN</a> with you. Apparently in Finland, Jesus didn't call either. But he did text message. But now he's not allowed to do that anymore. Fucking bureaucrats.</p>
<p>Last piece of bussiness. <a href="http://www.mikerowesoft.com/">MikeRoweSoft.com</a>. Microsoft says take it down and we'll give you $10. The kid is from Canada which leads me to believe that they would give him 10 loonies (10 Canadien dollars) which is worth about $7.50 American. Anyway Microsoft says we'll give you $10,  he's like fuck you give me $10,000. That rules. Power to the people. I suppose they'll be going after <a href="http://www.mightgrowsoft.com/">MightGrowSoft.com</a> next.</p><p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/internet/01/21/offbeat.porn.prayer.reut/index.html">A final thought.</a></p>
