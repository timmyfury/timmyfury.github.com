I was working with one of the librarians at work this afternoon and I made a comment about how coffee rules my life.  She responded with a joke about a coffee enema.  Although she is into wholistic medicine she does not participate in such a thing.  I did some research.

I have been interested in the whole concept of a daily enema and fasting regiment since I heard a piece on NPR about a guy who did it to see if fasting caused enlightenment. Regardless of whether I would ever do it or not, I think its interesting.

Here's my favorite part from this website that I selected among the 7,000 some odd <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=coffee+enema">results on google</a>. I chose to read <a href="http://www.ineedcoffee.com/">INeedCoffee.com's</a> information.
<blockquote cite="http://www.ineedcoffee.com/01/01/enema/">The effects of a coffee enema are different than a saline enema. The most important difference between a saline enema and a coffee enema is the presence of caffeine in the coffee. Caffeine, theophylline and theobromine, combine to stimulate the relaxation of smooth muscles causing dilatation of blood vessels and bile ducts. The effects of having a coffee enema are not the same as drinking coffee. The veins of the anus are very close to the surface of the tissue. The caffeine is therefore absorbed more quickly (and in higher concentration) than it is in when coffee is drunk.

This just may be what I am looking for.  An enema regiment which would clean me out and wake me up every morning.
