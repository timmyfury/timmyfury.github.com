    content: "Ok, there is a flaw in your statements.... the bit about him charging the shit out of your credit card.... Unless you have shares on your computer that expose directories with temporary internet information such as cookies or cached pages, he couldnt get your card to do so. What he was doing was borderline illegal, its not like he was setting up a direct line to permanently take advantage of your connection (ie:stealing cable). But he would never get prosecuted and you wont get a cop to arrest him, its about as serious as jay walking. Now if he was using your connection and thus your IP to perform illegal acts online he would be prosecutable... but you'd have to catch him first. This would basically involve looking at your logs and finding his MAC address, every ethernet card's is unique so there you go.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      BTW, if you have shares, readable to everyone, that expose vital information thats what you should fix first.... thats just stupid. "

    content: I am not a complete bloody idiot.  I understand the basics of hacking and more so the internet.  It was a general statement addressing illegal activities.  I know he wouldn't be able to charge my credit card.  It was stated that way for emphasis. And as for having shared folders available?  Come on now.  I've owned a computer since I was 10.  I should know a thing or two by now.

    content: Yeah Don, your right.  I should never do anything that has the remote chance of having a bad outcome. Better not leave the house anymore.  I might get hit by a car or a tree might fall on me or catch a cold.  Best to assume that the worst is going to happen and that everyone is out to get me.

      I understand computer security, To an extent.  Its not my life but its inthe back of my mind.  There are so many things in the world that I could worry about; why choose computer security.  Avian flu, peak oil, terrorism, erosion of civil liberties; the point is that you have to weigh how your concern is going to impede on your everyday conveniances and decide which you care about more.  My general opinion is that if someone wants my information, they are going to get it.  Attacking me personally isn't going to be as profitable as attacking a large corporation.  You may be able to get away with it more easily but its a lot less profitable, so in turn a lot less worthy of the time.  
      
      Futhermore, the ability to recover from identity theft or stolen credit card numbers is ten thousand times easier than it was five years ago and gets better everyday.  
      
      I've got bigger fish to fry.  I've got more things to worry about than things I can't control.  I can't spend my life living in the shadows because I'm afraid something bad may happen to me someday.  Besides, I'm a risk taker.  It gives me a half stock to use wireless.  What a thrill!

    content: no, he has a wireless connection that used to be wide open. my computer is wired because i only have one and if i want to use my laptop i just plug it in. However i do keep a was point open that doesnt actually connect to anything. Mostly because i forgot i had decided not to use it, but partially because it would confuse a wardriver... google honeypot.

<p>Trish and I arrived from the gym tonight and someone was parked in <a href="http://www.grindinglight.com/blog/">Burn's</a> spot.  As I walked past his car I noticed that there was someone in the car and they were surfing <a href="http://www.myspace.com">myspace</a> on a laptop.  I'm walking to the door and realize, that guy is skimming off my wireless connection.  Looks like we got ourselves a <a href="http://www.answers.com/main/ntquery?s=war+driver&method=2&gwp=13">war driver</a>.  So we go inside and unplug the modem and sure enough when he was finished with the page he was reading, he clicked on another link and realized that the large man staring at him from the doors in front of him had disconnected him.</p>
<p>With him gone I logged into the wireless router we use to connect Trish to the network in our apartment.  I locked that shit down tight. Limit by MAC address, limit number of IP's, encrypt the shit out of it, password the wireless, password the network, rename the network, you name it, if it was an option, I did it.  We were lucky though.  This guy was really only out for a quick myspace fix.  Luckily he wasn't out for a quick, charge the shit out of my credit card fix.</p>
<p>Moral of the story, <strong>lock your fucking network down</strong>.</p>
