<p>After recent, extensive personnel changes at <a href="http://www.dccc.edu">the college</a>, the creative freedoms of my department at work have shifted significantly in a positive way.  This article, <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/89/creativity.html">The 6 Myths of Creativity</a>, is interesting though and I think alot of people, from the lowest to the highest, could benefit from the research that Teresa Amabile is doing in creativity research.</p>

<p>Her first myth, "Creativity Comes From Creative Types",  is my favorite.  I have found that a significant amount of people at <a href="http://www.dccc.edu">the college</a> either don't give their own ideas enough credit or don't give each other enough credit. </p>

<p>Michael and I had a meeting today that I watched peoples faces explode with inspiration as they arrived at the same ideas as we had without our coaxing and without the same training and knowledge as we have.  These people still think that we came up with the ideas and we will probably be given credit but really it was their inspiration, not ours, that will lead to improvements in the application that we are building for them.</p>

<p>Since I moved into a new office and began my new position two weeks ago, I have heard at least three people call the Web Services office the center of the institutions creative juices (among other things - the bachelor pad, the frat house - I digress).  It's almost sad that people think that.  I'm not saying that the new department isn't creative.  I'm not saying that we don't accomplish alot of things that haven't been attempted before now.  I'm just saying that there are alot of very creative, interesting ideas coming out of every part of the institution and perhaps more people should give themselves credit.</p>
