    content: I wouldn't abandon Picasa for Flickr, although I think Flickr is cool.  As of right now, Flickr doesn't let you get complete backups of your images (if it were me, I'd have memebers have the option to subscribe to DVD backups quarterly of everything they upload and package software and advertising in it).  You can still apply labels in Picasa, as well as descriptions.  Personally, I've dreaded losing a hard drive and all of my pictures - inside Picasa, you can backup ALL of you pictures either as a full Picasa-reinstall or images only.  Another workaround is to configure your Flickr account to receive pictures by email, and then to send you photos via Picasa/gmail to Flickr.  Basically, it does the same thing as Flickr uploader, just inside Picasa's interface.

      Flickr would be way cooler if you could upload via FTP. The uploadr tool that they offer takes forever to process my mass uploads of more than 75 images. I have to wait 15 minutes for it to allow me to upload them. Someone should build a hack for Picasa that integrates it with Flickr.

    content: The Joint Combat Camera Center at the Pentagon allows for Flickr like tagging with FTP upload.  Not sure how the software works, but I add the meta information in photoshop using the "file info" feature... ftp the file... and it draws all the information out and adds it to a database automatically.  It also has a neat feature in that it allows users to create their own albums and tags of your images.  So if I'm looking for shots of Marines treating POWs with first aid, I can collect my results from several places in one album (they call a photo box), then decide what I need later.  So far as fearing data loss, I'm bought into the idea of using an external hard drive  for on site backup (I'm lovin a 500GB Lacie drive right now) and plan to get a tape drive for off site storage when I get home.  I get a free security deposit box with my checking account and plan to drop a tape off every other week or so.  If my house and bank burn to the ground at the same time, I'll have bigger issues than losing my photos!

      Brain and Rascal, I am totally into getting everything off of my own computer.  At some point I may want a backup of all those images I have sent to flickr but for now I want them archived and backedup and more immediately I want them described.  I thought that picassa would satisfy my needs but it didn't.  I was sort of a waste of time.  I ended up spending a bunch of time on sorting and it still wasn't easy to find images.  For looking at digital images I have to say flickr is far superior to picassa.  It just flows.  I should say it just flows for me.  It works like I work. 
      
      As for having bigger problems than photos if your house burns down, you may have more problems in the immediate but in the long run there is nearly nothing that you would lose (save the life of a loved one) that could not be replaced other than photos.  When photos are gone they are gone.  Couches or books or computers can be replaced.  Photos and the lost memories they may help you uncover are irreplacable.

    content: "Yahoo is taking a bet with Flickr... either users won't sign up for the premium service (revenue from ads is higher than cost of serving limited space) or that premium members won't \xC3\xA2\xE2\x82\xAC\xC5\x93over-use\xC3\xA2\xE2\x82\xAC\xC2\x9D the service ($25 a year revenue higher than cost of hosting).  I personally have 60 gigs of hi-res original images from the last five months alone.   When someone like me (or probably you) signs up for their premium service... they lose money on our account.  \r\n\
      \r\n\
      It simply isn't a profitable idea to offer unlimited storage for free (which $25 might as well be) in the long term.  And profit is what drives Yahoo.  Period.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Why does this matter?\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Because my tape drive doesn't make it's first general condition of use \"We reserve the right to modify or TERMINATE the Flickr.com service for ANY reason, WITHOUT NOTICE at ANY TIME.\"  (Emph added.)  \r\n\
      \r\n\
      My tape drive is also not a Beta system which Yahoo is still on the fence about keeping up once the trial is over.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      You always risk losing data... but trusting your memories to a stockholder held corporation makes less sense than worrying about a house fire and meteor hitting your bank at the same time.  If I were you, I'd run a quit smoking campaign in your apartment building, invest in a fire proof safe and look into designing a desktop app that works as well or better than flickr and retire on selling it to Microsoft as part of Windows 2010."

      Every service you sign up for has that condition in the TOS.  It gives them power if they need it.  Storage costs nothing.  The cost of storage is so low that its nearly nothing. As of yesterday there are <a href="http://blog.flickr.com/flickrblog/2005/07/1000000_members.html" rel="nofollow">1,000,000 users</a> The number of those users who have paid? I don't know.  But I am sure that the greatest number of those is not like you or I.
      
      I think for Yahoo, they already have farms with Gig upon gig of bandwidth. Who cares if you add another 10 gig.  Whats the price increase.  Most likely minimal.  
      
      I certainly don't expect flickr to be around forever (sob), the next installment addresses this concept and tell what I want to do.  Wait for it.  You'll see why I am dumping all this information into flickr.

      I'd almost rather have my own application, that I develop as my main "image management system."
      
      For example, I'd like to use Flickr for corporate/business use, but they don't allow it - and rightfully so. The point is, those restrictions are not necessary, when I could, very well, come up with a feasible solution, using SQL, PHP, or something like that.
      
      What really "spins my head" is the fact that there are too many image management utilities, and I'd like to have ONE utility - that can store unlimited images, for business or personal use - and that runs on the web, or the desktop.
      
      Right now there are web tools (Flickr), desktop tools (Picasa, iPhoto) - and dozens more variations of each.
      
      It's too much for me.
      
      And if there's too many options, that means I should just create something of my own, and use that. That way, I'm not limited to "business vs. personal," or having my account be disabled, etc. In other words, I'd be in complete control.

    content: I also have to pose the question of whether Microsoft will join this fight.  It is very possible that the next version of windows (or a version of linux, for that matter) will handle image tagging and management.  I find it hard to believe that they MSN would allow yahoo a leg up on anything on the web unchallenged unless directed not to wase their time.

    content: I use ACDSEE (http://www.acdsystems.com/) and am pretty happy with it. Also, a good one is Alex Kings Photos (http://www.alexking.org/index.php?content=software/photos/content.php), which is open source and supported by him.

<p>A few years ago I started thinking about what would happen if my parents house burnt down and all my childhood images were lost, or worse, all the images of my parents and their parents were lost too.  A thourough family history lost to flame. That's rough. That's alot of history. I have commented before that I think I am the single most photographed person on earth.  There are literally ten-thousand images of me over the course of my life.  My brother and sisters too.</p>
<p>The though of this made me cringe.  I enjoy not only leafing through the images but feel that someday these will be the things that allow my children's children to get an idea of who I was and how life was when I was young (that is to say that some wonderful science isn't found to prevent me from becoming a vegetable by eighty years old). So I decided that the best thing to do was to scan every single image in my mother's house (I swear I wasn't high).  It's an undertaking that has nearly swallowed me.  Sometimes I am really into it and other times I really couldn't care less.</p>
<p>I've scanned images from my father's and mother's childhoods and paintings and poems and handprints from all of my siblings.  I've scanned images so old that no one remembers what they are anymore.</p>
<p>The problem then is how the hell do I remember what these images are and who is in them and when they were taken.  There's a bounty of information that you might need when you actually want to use these images later.  File names and folder structures can only take you so far on this.</p>
<p>I searched and searched for software to help me with the collection of image information.  I tried Picassa, it nearly solved the problem but wasn't perfect for what I was looking for.  Then I finally tried <a href="http://flickr.com">flickr</a>. As you may already know I am madly in love with flickr.  But there is a reason for my childish infatuation which stretches far beyond the desire to share and lookat photos.</p>
<p>When images are uploaded they are tagged (categorized) and dated and captioned and titled.  Most importantly though, they are backed up somewhere where the evil life erasing fire can't get it (theoretically).</p>
<p>This still doesn't solve the issue of sitting down at the kitchen table with the kids and leafing through your albums telling stories and laughing like any good hallmark family does, but its just the setup.</p>
