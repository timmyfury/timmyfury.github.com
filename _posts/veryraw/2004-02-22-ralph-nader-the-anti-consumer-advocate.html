<p>This November we will have an election that pits George Bush against either   John Edwards or John Kerry. Bush currently stands with a <a href="http://www.pollingreport.com/BushJob.htm">48%   job approval rating</a>. In comparisons between Bush and the Democratic prsidential hopefuls Bush stands very close to ebing able to pull an upset and keep the   White House. I think an upset would be if Bush was really low in the polls and   he came back but in this context I am refering to what I will be if Bush wins   this year... UPSET. Regardless, Bush stands within only a few points of Kerry   for the White House in November and Bush and Edwards would be <a href="http://www.pollingreport.com/wh04gen.htm">neck   and neck</a>. All this information aside let's take a look at the <a href="http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/2000presgeresults.htm">2000   election</a> for president that brought Bush into power. Al Gore, who regardless   of the fact that he may have very well simply been the lesser of two evils,   lost in both Florida (by less than 600 votes) and New Hampshire (a less dramatic   8000 votes). These are both significant states in the election and had Gore   won either of these states he most likely would have won the election. Our next   observation is that Ralph Nader has similar mores as the Democratic party. Therefore   if he didn't want the far right Republican bovine to remain in power you may   think that he wouldn't want to take votes from the Democratic candidate in November   like he did in 2000. How many votes did Nader get in Florida and New Hampshire?   97,488 and 22,198 respectively. One might think that with as close as the platforms   that Nader and the Democrats (a really politcally charged name for an anti-Republican   punk band) run on Nader may have decided not to run this November. If this is   what you thought, you would be <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/02/22/elec04.prez.nader/index.html">wrong</a>.   I think that Kerry and Edwards are gonna have to team up on this one and run   together. </p>
<p>Next on the adgenda is the comment left to me by "A Person" on last the <a href="http://www.timmyfury.com/history/microsoftruinssearch/">February 18th</a> update. A Person says, "<a href="http://www.timmyfury.com/comment/microsoftruinssearch/">Your obsessed with directories.</a>" You are obviously new to the web design   world and I bet you think that all of the directories actually exist. Using   directories makes you URL's very managable. By putting these fake directories   into a database it also makes your updates very managable. Then if one day I decide to go from PHP to ASP (god rest my soul on that day) or maybe Coldfusion   (if I had an enormous amount of money to waste on a crappy blog) then it would   make the transition smooth and effortless. This is called forethought. In addition   if you were to read the <a href="http://www.weirdhead.org/mission/">mission statement on Weirdhead.org</a> you would be clued in a bit more to my current drive in web design. You wanna see alot of directories go to Weirdhead.org. Let me know if you have anymore quips about my design style. If you are in fact   new to the scene (I'm a loser) try reading up on <a href="http://www.w3.org">web   accessibility and standards</a>. </p>
<p>That guy who does <a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com">Rands in Repose</a>   also apparently has something to do with <a href="http://www.jerkcity.com/jerkcity1965.html">this</a>.</p>

<p>...<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99994685">I can't   find the right words to tell you</a>...</p>
<p>Finally I have bought floors for my Buick. I am super excited about this. I haven't really done anything with my car in like a million years (10 months).   I ordered $415 worth of floor pans. I keep you up to date on the progress. A big shout out to Alex from <a href="http://www.opgi.com">OPGI</a> for helping me order the right shit.</p>
<p>It could be worse. <a href="http://www.thecostumer.com/store/product.cfm?prodID=1058">This</a> could be you.</p>
