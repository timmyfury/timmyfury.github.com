<p>I recently bought a helmet (finally) to wear while I ride.  Particularly in Media the chances of getting hit by a car are, in my eyes, pretty solid.  I thought it might pay to have something to prevent my head from getting destroyed when I do eventually get hit.  Also with the gift certificate Trish gave me for timbuk2 <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/timmyfury/27180248/">I got a new bag</a>.  It's pretty awesome.  Makes carrying a bag while riding super easy and I can fit like eight human heads in it... or clothes for work.</p>
<p>I've mentioned before that I have been doing some research into bike touring.  It's something that I would like tyo do a little of next spring and, if I like it, alot more the year after with a trek cross country.  Jason Hill is riding from the Arctic Circle to Tierra del Fuego, Argentina and <a href="http://www.tourparabienestar.com/blog/">telling his story along the way</a>.  I've been reading this blog for a little while.  It's better than the other stories about touring I've read because this one unfolds over time because he's doing it right now. Worth a read if you are interested in the trials of distance biking.</p>
<p>This link is half for me and half for y'all.  Someday (if I actually do ride cross country) I will need the information about flying home.  <a href="http://www.ibike.org/encouragement/travel/bagregs.htm">Airline regulations for flying with your bike</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.northwestwatch.org/publications/sevenwondersexcerpt.asp">This article</a> gives the skinny on why bikes rule, as if you needed more reasons.</p>
<blockquote> North Americans might not believe it, but my love affair with my vehicle puts me, not my Oprah sofa-mate, squarely in the transportation mainstream. The bicycle is the world's most widely used transport vehicle. Worldwide, bicycles outnumber automobiles almost two to one, and their production outpaces cars three to one. Rush-hour traffic in China is dominated by human-powered vehicles; even in the wealthy cities of Europe and Japan, large shares of the populace get around by bike.</blockquote>
<p>It also mentions that a human on a bicycle is the most efficient creature or vehicle on earth.</p>
<p>Programs of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/france/story/0,11882,1547732,00.html">the one in Paris</a> are rad.  I would love if they had something like <a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/000899.html">these programs</a> at Temple.  Should would make it easier to get to class form the train station in time.  Or maybe get across campus for another class.</p>
<p>And last a few bike related links that I found interesting but never shared</p>
