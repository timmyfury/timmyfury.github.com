      Oh, but no Mac support for Picassa yet...? come on! :)
      
      I am really amazed, too, by Google's developments lately - they are mind-bending.

<p>Well, I have been offline at home for two days.  What a joke.  It's all gravy though.  Gave me some time to read and scan images.  Have you seen <a href="http://www.picasa.com/">Google's Picassa</a>?  Amazing.  It's given me control over my image information that I never thought was possible.  Leave it to Google I suppose.  I really think I am just going to give up and turn my life over to Google.  More on this later.</p>

<p>I have had some time to think about the site though.  I have a ton of ideas for veryraw.  I am not sure how I am going to execute them yet.  I am going to add some new sections and shit.  I found the archives from timmyfury (for those of you who were here last year).  I am going to post that.  I think I am going to put up a section for some illustrations and animations from old.  Little more integration of other services (audioscrobbler, del.icio.us).  More frequent updates.  A portfolio which is slowly becoming something worthwhile. And finally a gallery area.  The galleries will probably be a passworded area.  I have alot of images that I would like to share but its really a controlled area.  Don't want the world seeing everything.</p>

<p>The other major change will be the implementation of wordpress 1.5.  It looks pretty amazing.  I had wrestled with the idea of abandoning wordpress altogether and developing my own blogging software again but there's really no ROI on that.  The only reason to do that would be to build on my skills but I don't foresee it helping me expand on anything that I am currently focusing.  So I'll stick with wordpress.  When I do it the site is gonna be really messed up for a few days.  It'll still be functional though.</p>

<p>If you hadn't noticed I have been playing with the right column.  I have added a running list of 15 links from my del.icio.us profile.  They are really just everything that I want to save.  You're getting everything there.  The nerdiest of the nerdy and the best of the best links.  I haven't decided how to deal with that yet but I was getting tired of having all those links lying around so there you are. Furthermore, there are alot of links over there.  Mark has complained but I'm really paying attention to what I actually read and find most interesting and when I switch over to 1.5 I will narrow that a bit.  Again it's one of those things that I have been thinking about.</p>

<p>So this may, for many of you, be a completely superflous entry.  It was almost more of a gather my thoughts entry.  Free association and the like.   I have alot of ideas right now and I need to keep track or I'll lose it all.</p>
