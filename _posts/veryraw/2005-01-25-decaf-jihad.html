<p>Whenever we go for coffee after 10:00 <a href="http://iam.thecolossus.net/">Mark</a> drinks decaf.  I on the other hand refuse.  I have argued many times that for a coffee bean to give up its caffeine they must do something horrible and unholy to it. In this month's <a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/">National Geographic</a> there is an excellent article about why we love caffeine.  In the article is the image which I have scanned and included below.  I don't know about you but that sure looks unholy to me.</p>

<p>The caption for the image reads...</p>

<blockquote>Here's whats missing from your decaf: A shovelful of caffeine and wax residues rises from the muck as workers decaffeinate coffee beans at a plant in Trieste, Italy</blockquote>
