<p>As I noted a few weeks ago, I have been <a href="http://veryraw.com/history/2005/07/living-in-meatspace/">busy with my move</a>.  Trish and I have been in our new place for a week now and things are really getting together.  I am finally hanging pictures and mirrors after some painting and organizing.  We have filled the dumpster for our building twice now with things we are throwing away and the best part, I went out and bought a grill last night.  Life is good.</p>
<p>The move has really initiated a life style change of sorts.  I call this my quality of life move.  Not only am I living with Trish now, which lets me see her more often, but it also cuts all driving times significantly.  I have a 5 minute drive to work now.  Instead of getting home around 6:30, I'm finishing dinner around 6:30.  This obviously gives me a lot more time at night to do what I want at night.  Furthermore, I am not making three trips a week to Trish's house a whopping 40 miles from my house.</p>
<p>The other difference is that with a refridgerator full of food and beer, I end up eating out less.  Very healthy.  I actually feel better physically.  and I eat more regularly.</p>
<p>Then there's the coffee pot.  My god.  How nice is it to have a coffee pot in your place.  Cutting my drive from an hour to five minutes in the morning has given me 55 minutes to sit in my apartment and enjoy a half of a pot of coffee before I go to work.  Drinking coffee in your underwear is always better than drinking it in your car on the way to work.</p>
<p>I'll take some pictures of the place and post them so you can see what I'm living like.</p>
