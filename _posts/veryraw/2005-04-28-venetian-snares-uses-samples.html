<p>I listened to the new Venetian Snares album, <a href="http://www.venetiansnares.com/">Winnepeg is a frozen shithole</a> breifly in Mark's car today.  Really good.  I haven't had a chance to "buy it" myself but after the amazing breaks and hard bass of the new album, I had a hankerin' for some sweet sweet Venetian Snares.</p>
<p>There is one particular song that I have always thought was really good in addition to making me laugh my ass off. The samples in this song are amazing.  I don't even know where someone would go about getting samples like this.  I have discussed this song with Mark before and I don't know if we ever came to a consensus or not.  The song is in my computer as "Venetian Snares - Doormouse Megamix." This is where the point of contention was I think.  If anyone else knows anything about this, let me know.</p>
<p>Here is a nice list of the samples, transcribed for your enjoyment. I do not try to suggest that my transcription skills are perfect, but you'll get the general idea.</p>
<ol>
<li>Chairs made of pussy hairs!</li>
<li>I hear people make reference to the perfect teeth with no cavities, to the perfect 20/20 vision, to the intercontinental teeth with no cavities champion, from the perfect me,  Tito Santana and your looking at him Tito Santana and what your looking at is what perfect teeth with no cavities champions are made of!</li>
<li>Welcome!</li>
<li>you've got mail!</li>
<li>He once drank 140 beers in one sitting and then had wine with dinner.</li>
<li>B-E-E-R (in the voice of a speak and spell)</li>
<li>Six million ways to die. Choose one.</li>
<li>Toxic jungle</li>
<li>Peeing on each other and stuff like that when they get older. And if you dont have ten seperate cages for em then they start fightin' and then the males will castrate the other males. They do. They chew their balls right off.  Then we have a bloody mess. Thats why you got to butcher them when they get to a certain age or you have a heck of a mess.</li>
</ol>
