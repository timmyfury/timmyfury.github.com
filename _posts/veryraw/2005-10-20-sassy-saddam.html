Although I don't have any particular interest in anything going on in the Middle East other than my addiction to petroleum and my desire to own a flying carpet or genie lamp, I have been following the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> saga since before his capture.  I'm not saying that I'm all pro-Saddam or anything.  I wouldn't exactly call myself a Ba'athist, but the man is intriguing if nothing else.  I have heard thousands of news reports about him since the capture in late 2003 and he has remained ever defiant.  I don't think I have heard a single report that doesn't have him calling someone a dog or an infidel.  The man knows that this trial will lead to his hanging in a public square and still, when asked to state his name in court, he says things like (paraphrased) 'I will not answer this question because as the president of Iraq, I do not recognize this as a legitimate court.'  I heard on NPR the other night that when he was visited by Iraqi officials shortly after his capture, that he basically called them all pussy's for not coming to kill him.  Man that guy is defiant as shit. Shortly after his capture, his oldest daughter stated "Saddam was tranquillised when captured [...] He would be a lion even when caged. Every honest person who knows Saddam knows that he is firm and powerful." Preach on girl! Hallelujah!

I wish there was a record of all the people he has called an infidel.  And if there were such a record I would like to travel to Iraq, find Saddam and get my name on that very long list. I would also like to get shirts made that read "Saddam called me an infidel!"  I'm still working on a design.
