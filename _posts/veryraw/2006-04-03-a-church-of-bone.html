<p>Every now and then I catch something on flickr that makes me stop and say wow.  <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/thecnote/">Thecnote</a> has posted a set of images from the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/thecnote/sets/72057594096613716/">Sedlec Ossuary</a> in the Czech Republic.  As the surrounding cemetary became more popular, the land became full and bodies were exhumed and the bones stacked in this ossuary.  My favorites?  The <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/thecnote/121816630/in/set-72057594096613716/">bone chandelier</a> and the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/thecnote/121816791/in/set-72057594096613716/">bone garland</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedlec_ossuary">Read more on wikipedia</a>.</p>
