<h3>sensationalism type two: "I found that cool thing before you did!"</h3>
<p>I am guilty of this to an extent.  I <a href="http://veryraw.com/history/2005/04/oh-my-freaking-hell/">pimped flickr</a> (still do) and <a href="http://veryraw.com/history/2005/02/delicious-one/">swung from the balls of del.icio.us</a> (still do).  But over the last few days a bunch of blogs I read and news sites have been dishing the scoop on google talk.  This is before it even came out.  Talking about how its gonna rule and crap.  It finally hit today and after trying it for one day it gets a resounding two thumbs down from me.  You have no file sharing and it doesn't communicate with AOL.  Forget it.  Furthermore, its based on my gmail address.  I get about 50 spam a day there.  If I use google talk, they are gonna call me all day long to talk to me about how small my wang is or how suzie gets stuffed. I have never had a problem with AIM in eight years of using it and they are going to have to give me a damn good reason to leave.</p>
<p>My point here is that everyone needs to just calm down on trying to tell everyone how wonderfult he next thing to come out of google labs is.  A few weeks ago whent hey gave you the ability to look at your search history (a truly beautiful thing) everyone was crying foul that google was tracking everything they did.  Now google is great again just because everyone wants to be the first to get the rumor out there. Everyone be cool.  All google has done is released <a href="http://messenger.yahoo.com/">another</a> <a href="http://messenger.msn.com/Xp/Default.aspx">worthless</a> <a href="http://www.google.com/talk/">messenger</a>.</p>
<h3>In closing</h3>
<p>If you are going to get all crazy over something, get nuts over something real.  How about the fact that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiwifruit">kiwi fruit are also called Chinese Gooseberries</a> or that the bug you have called a Japanese beetle for your entire life is actually called a fiery searcher</p>
