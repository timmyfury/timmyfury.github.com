<p>In my attempts to pimp <a href="http://flickr.com/">flickr</a> to every person I know, I have been thinking alot about photography and pictures.  One of the realizations I have come to is that I am not a photographer.  I like to take pictures.  I like to look at pictures.  I even like to show my pictures to people.  But I'm not a photographer.  Although this is sort of a depressing realization for such a total wanna-be, its been sort of liberating.  I shoot and shoot and shoot and no matter how crappy the world may think the images are, I share them anyway.  You figure if I shoot a thousand pictures, eventually one of them has to catch someone's eye.</p>
<p>I may not be a photographer, but sometimes an image just needs a little help to become something really cool.  Of course photoshop never hurt no one.  so a little doctoring may be in order.</p>
<p>Below is one of those images.  This is an the Antonov cargo plane that came into Philadelphia International while I was working for USAir.  It was awesome.  Freaking huge.</p>
<p>I removed some of the debris and sharpened the image a bit and I think it improved the image alot.</p>
