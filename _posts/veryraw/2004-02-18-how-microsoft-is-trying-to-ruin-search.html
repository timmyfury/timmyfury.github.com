<p>I spoke to one of the librarians at work the other day following her gathering   which revolved around the infamous "virus protection." What she,   and I for that matter, found to be most entertaining about it was the insinuation that the viruses that have been taking down systems in the country over the   past year had something to do with the ever sinister and devious Al Qaeda. The   fact of the matter is that I have not been able to find any real proof that any of the most recent virus proliferation has anything to do with terrorism   or an attack on the much sought after "national security."</p>
<p>I read <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-7349_3-5158496.html">something very interesting last night</a> which is the root to why I am giving all of you this   information. As you may know Linux is an open-source operating system. It is   free in most cases and there is a strong following in the hacker/web design/server   administration sector of the information technology industry for Linux. It touts   a highly secure environment mostly due to the fact that the source code or the   programming behind how it works is open to everyone, including hackers. This   gives everyone the ability to examine the code and find possible security holes   and exploits. This is a very different approach than our good friends at Microsoft take. Their source code is highly protected. In fact recently about <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-7349_3-5158496.html">1/10th of 1 percent </a>of the code behind Microsoft's Windows 2000 professional   was leaked and within a week there were already two highly damaging exploits shared on the internet; in other words two gaping security holes.</p>
<p>  There is a company called SCO which makes server operating system software. They claim that the creators of Linux have stolen a chunk of their code and   they have vowed to sue a large-scale Linux user by today, November18th. Many think this user will be Google. Yes, that's right, our long time friend   and ever gracious searching savior. Google is rumored to have somewhere close to 10,000 servers running Linux. </p>
<p>Now here's where it gets a little tricky and I'm not sure if the logic of this and the connection to all of you will come through here.</p>
<p>The myDoom virus was written to attack SCO and Microsoft specifically because of this lawsuit. Microsoft is involved because they want to take Linux out of the operating system game. </p>
<p>Now for the reason that you care. "And Microsoft, which has been accused of conniving with SCO in its march against Linux, is slated to enter the search   market and compete against Google. The widgetry, which is supposed to retrieve all kinds of file types, both structured and unstructured, and all kinds of   storage systems, beginning with the user's own drive, will be integrated into its operating systems like the anticipated Longhorn."</p>
<p>This is important and I believe you should all be interested because the ever evil, corporate whoring, monster which is Microsoft could be changing your search in a big way sometime in the near future. In addition, if Microsoft were to include this searching capability in their OS which included searching your personal PC there could be some very serious ramifications. Just imagine if   you had say 7,732 mp3 files on your PC and the RIAA decided to search for them.   Big problem thats a $1,159,800,000 fine you have on your hands there my friend. It's enough to make me go Mac or Linux.</p>
<p>Just to wrap it up I think maybe I should point out the point to this rant   because I believe I strayed a bit while I was trying to show you the connection   of this information to us. Viruses are not targeted toward national security. They are targeted toward greedy corporations who try to hinder the development of computing. Secondly, not all hackers  are bad. Some have the security of computing   in mind. And last, Google could be in trouble so keep them in mind in  your bed-time   prayers.</p>
<p>A final thought on the subject from that article on <a href="http://www.linuxworld.com/">LinuxWorld.com</a>, "Meanwhile, industry wags are saying that God invented SCO to give people a company to hate more than Microsoft."</p>
