    content: the new iraq government backfired completely on bush.instead of the shoe-ins that were puppeted up by us, the iraqis came out in droves to elect very anti-U.S. leaders. the quagmire that is iraq will always be a stain on our international policy, never a point of redemption for bush.exoneration is impossible for a man that has misled the country under so many different guises. private accounts where you can't choose your investments? i'd rather that social security was completely abolished then to line the pockets political insiders. who is going to invest the money of the people? are brokers working for free? take a program that uses less than 2% of it's budget for administartion cost, and push it further into the mud. reform is a great idea...it should start with a flat income and social security tax, followed by a federal sales tax. only 3 more years to go...

I must admit, when the election was wrapped up I <a href="http://veryraw.com/history/2004/11/bush-wins-we-all-lose/">flamed</a> about how stupid Bush voters were and how the country was going to fail.  I wasn't really mad, I was drenched in despair.  I was sad; very sad.

Four months later the feelings of remorse are gone.  The things that I thought were going to happen haven't happened.  The war in Iraq (which was not one of my issues) has, at least for the time being, seemed to spark a near epidemic of Middle Eastern Democracy&trade;.  Nations we never though would embrace the flavor of Middle Eastern Democracy&trade; are jumping on the bandwagon like its full of free Kalishnakofs.  Some oposition groups in these countries have gone as far as to say that Bush's invasion of Iraq was the starting point for these reforms - in other words, without them there would be little change.  

As for social security, which is the only other big move that Bush has pushed since his inuaguration in January, I don't have a problem with what he's saying.  There have been minimal specifics but <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4525458">Bush is touting his plan</a> like a superstar.  There are alot of problems and benefits but to be honest, the important thing is that he gets people talking about it.  With the exception of minor changes and modifications to who and how people can receive their benefits, no president has really touched Social security since its <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/history/history.html">inception</a>.  I really don't think that Bush's major contribution to Social Security will be reform.  I think it will be rhetoric.

What really bothered me about Bush's re-election was less about the next four years and more about the next thirty.  There was alot of talk about the chance for whoever was elected to nominate up to <a href="http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/justices/fullcourt.html">four supreme court justices</a>.  This scared me because the impact of a judge spans a lifetime as opposed to the duration of a term.  Furthermore, they aren't elected so they can stay non-partisan&trade;.  

The popular interpretation of the system of checks and balances gives the Supreme Court a whole lot more power than the President or Congress.  They rule on the actions of both branches in a direct way and, whether or not its the way its supposed to be, they have final say in what happens in government.  This of course may be an improper interpretation but it is the way I see it and a trend that I have seen in conversations prior to and since the election.

<a href="http://www.legalaffairs.org/issues/March-April-2005/review_strauss_marapr05.msp">Legal Affairs</a> published a piece which corroborated my viewpoint.

<blockquote>SHOULD THE SUPREME COURT HAVE THE LAST WORD on what the Constitution means? Among the justices, and probably the general population as well, the answer seems obvious: Of course it should. That is what it means to be governed by law. But among constitutional law scholars, one of the hot new ideas is "popular constitutionalism," a theory that "the people," acting through politics, should determine the meaning of the Constitution. According to the popular constitutionalists, either the Supreme Court should get out of the business of interpreting the Constitution or, more combatively, the people should retaliate against the court when it interprets the Constitution in ways with which they disagree.<br /><a href="http://www.legalaffairs.org/issues/March-April-2005/review_strauss_marapr05.msp">Legal Affairs: Pop Con</a></blockquote>

This is a point that I have never thought and puts me a little more at ease.  The idea that after a law or action is shot down by the courts, it could be brought back to life in another way by the other branches is wonderful.  It gives some mortality to the decisions of the courts and puts less power in their hands. Perhaps this fact will help keep the Supreme Court impartial&trade; and non-partisan&trade;.
