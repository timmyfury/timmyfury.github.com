<p>Trish and I got back from Boston last night.  It was a wicked good weekend.  Eveything was hela fun.  I loved castle rock near Salem.  We of course climbed to the top and took a bunch of pictures.  actually we took tons of pictures.  Trish loves to take pictures of bizarre stuff.  Bulldogs. Railings. Tons of scenery.Then we got a bunch of pictures of us being sute. Sitting on rocks. Swinging from lamp posts.</p>

<p>That's me and Trish kickin it on top of Castle Rock near Salem.  That place is cool.  The little hispanic guy in the shorts to the left is from Puerto Rico.  He didn't speak very much English but I turned him onto the delight which is Dunkin Donuts.</p>

<p>Rockport, MA is a really great city too.  Lots of artists.  Trish bought a rockin glass painting of Einstein and I bought this mega cool box that was made in Mexico.  They are awesome I think I am going to get a few more just like it.</p>
<p>I can't wait to go to Venice, Italy with her over Christmas.  Trish is super awesome to travel with.  We like to do all the same things and we have an overload of fun. We didn't sleep enought though so I am mad tired.  Oh and we definately saw a woman that looks like that guy that drove herbie the lovebug in the movie.</p>
<p>The whole point to the trip was the whale watching cruise.  Six hours on a boat and like a third of the people nearly vomited. We saw alot of whales though.</p>
