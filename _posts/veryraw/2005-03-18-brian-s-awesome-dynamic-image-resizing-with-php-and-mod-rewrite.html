      Very nice. My only suggestion for improvement would be to add a resize cache so that you don't have to resize the image every time -- only when the image is newer than the cached image. I have no idea how my suggestions will format to your site after I post this comment, so bear with me ;)
      
      Here's the code:
      
      remove line 38 - (your header() declaration).
      to line 27 add the following:
      //first check cache
      $resized = 'cache/'.$tn_width.'x'.$tn_height.'-'.$image; //cache must be world-readable
      $imageModified = @filemtime($image);
      $thumbModified = @filemtime($resized);
      
      header(\"Content-type: image/jpeg\"); //move the header() up to here.
      
      /* if thumbnail is newer than image then output cached thumbnail and exit */
      if($imageModified&lt;$thumbModified) { 
      	header("Last-Modified: ".gmdate("D, d M Y H:i:s",$thumbModified)." GMT");
      	readfile($resized);
      	exit;
      }
      
      Then, after the line that reads:
      
      ImageJpeg($dst, null, -1);'
      
      Add the following:
      
      ImageJpeg($dst, $resized, -1); //write the thumbnail to the cache as well...

      well this is cool.  i _was_ mistaken.  line 35 should be:
      header("Content-type: image/jpeg");
      
      and while i'm at it, line 39 should be:
      header("Last-Modified: ".gmdate("D, d M Y H:i:s",$thumbModified)." GMT");
      
      also, my images and php script needed to be in a subdirectory of the site for development purposes, so here are the changes needed to get it running in a subdirectory.
      
      let's say you have http://domain.com, but you're working on a new site in the /new/ subdirectory.  furthermore, your images exist in the /new/images/ subdirectory.  here is one way to set it up:
      
      1. .htaccess notes
         - put .htaccess into /new/images/
         - the rewriterule 's should be more like this:
           RewriteRule ^small/([A-Za-z0-9]+)\.(jpg|gif|png)$ /new/resizer.php?max_width=50&amp;image=images\/$1\.$2
      
      2. resizer script
         - save the php code to a file such as /new/resizer.php
         - make the code modifications i listed above
      
      3. testing - put an image into /new/images/, then point your browser to http://domain.com/new/images/small/testimagename.jpg

<p><a href="#updated">This entry has been updated</a>.</p>
<p>When I did <a href="http://veryraw.com/history/2005/02/a-little-redesign-action/">my recent redesign</a>, I found that the best thing I had done in my original design was dynamic image resizing.  I could upload my images all resized and upload thumbnails for them too, but when I redesigned and wanted the images to be larger or smaller I would have wasted my time.</p>
<p>With a little help from <a href="http://us2.php.net/manual/en/ref.image.php">PHP's image functions</a> and <a href="http://www.modrewrite.com/">mod_rewrite</a> we can make image resizing really easy.
<h4>The htaccess file</h4>
</p><p>First we use mod_rewrite to interpret the URL and decide how large to set the maximum width. If I give the actual URL it will just give the original image.  By adding a false directory to the URL (I've chosen small, medium, large) the htaccess file will rewrite the URL and ship the request off to the resizing script.</p>
<pre>
<textarea rows="10" cols="50">
RewriteEngine on
RewriteBase /
# scaling small, medium, large
RewriteRule ^small/([A-Za-z0-9]+)\.(jpg|gif|png)$ index.php?max_width=100&image=$1\.$2
RewriteRule ^medium/([A-Za-z0-9]+)\.(jpg|gif|png)$ index.php?max_width=200&image=$1\.$2
RewriteRule ^large/([A-Za-z0-9]+)\.(jpg|gif|png)$ index.php?max_width=300&image=$1\.$2

</textarea>
</pre>
<h4>The resize script</h4>
<p>The meat of the process is here.  Some logic to figure out the proper dimensions and scale the image.  The the image functions.</p>
<pre>
<textarea rows="10" cols="50">

// max_width and image variables are sent by htaccess

$max_height = 1000;

$size = GetImageSize($image);
$width = $size[0];
$height = $size[1];

// get the ratio needed
$x_ratio = $max_width / $width;
$y_ratio = $max_height / $height;

// if image allready meets criteria, load current values in
// if not, use ratios to load new size info
if ( ($width < = $max_width) && ($height <= $max_height) ) {
  $tn_width = $width;
  $tn_height = $height;
} else if (($x_ratio * $height) < $max_height) {
  $tn_height = ceil($x_ratio * $height);
  $tn_width = $max_width;
} else {
  $tn_width = ceil($y_ratio * $width);
  $tn_height = $max_height;
}

// read image
$src = ImageCreateFromJpeg($image);

// set up canvas
$dst = imagecreatetruecolor($tn_width,$tn_height);

// copy resized image to new canvas
ImageCopyResized($dst, $src, 0, 0, 0, 0, $tn_width,$tn_height,$width,$height);

// send the header and new image
header("Content-type: image/jpeg");
ImageJpeg($dst, null, -1);

// clear out the resources
ImageDestroy($src);
ImageDestroy($dst);


</textarea>

<p>Together you get the ability to have a whole lot of image size possibilities while maintaining the original image size.</p>

<p>Feel free to take it, modify it and send me any improvements you make.</p>
<p>I must mention that the original version of this was sent to me two years ago by <a href="http://macweblog.blogspot.com/">Brian</a>.  I have since modified it about a thousand times and I am using it in a thousand different ways. Thanks Brian for introducing me to PHP image functions.</p>
<h3 id="updated">The Update</h3>
<p><a href="http://ad.hominem.org/">Trent</a> the new visitor has given me some great feedback on my script. He posted the code below but it was mangled.  So here it is. </p>
<p>We ditch a few lines of the script I gave and add a few others.  The new script creates a cache of the image at the new size and saves it in a directory within the image directory.  This may not be huge for a the meager amount of hits I receive each day but if you get anything sizable or perhaps if I was doing this professionally for a site that gets say... 10,000 hits a day, this could save precious processor time. You need to have a cache directory for this to work and the cache directory must be visible to the world.  Here's the code.  Thanks Trent!</p>
