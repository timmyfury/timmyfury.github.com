      Nice. I'm looking for something like that, here in Chicago. I would love to be around other 'standards freaks,' instead of just in the 'virtual world.'
      
      Somehow talking to people in person is a bit more rewarding than leaving comments on blogs.

      Sweet, I found one possibility already - http://webstandards.meetup.com/21/
      
      Thanks for linking to that site. I never knew about it.
      
      Now I can wear my <a href="http://simplebits.com/shop/tshirts/" rel="nofollow">SimpleBits t-shirts</a>, and people will recognize them!

Last night I went to the second meeting of the <a href="http://phillystandards.org/">Philly Standards Organization</a>.  Had a good time.  I was a little nervous before going cause I wasn't sure what the level of knowledge in the room would be.  I was pleasantly surprised though to find a very healthy mix of skill sets and a wild passion for web standards.  Its very rare that I walk into a room of people and feel nearly immediately at home.  Also stange to be around such a large group of people that all get my jokes.  There was great conversation and alot of awesome ideas thrown around.  There was a str0ong sense of community. There was even talk of guest speakers. In <a href="http://veryraw.com/history/2005/07/nerd-live-here/">a testiment to how much of a nerd I am</a>, I was totally half stock at the prospect of meeting some of the web standards originators.  Looking forward to seeing what else may come from the group, but for now I'm loving the strong desire for community within the group.
