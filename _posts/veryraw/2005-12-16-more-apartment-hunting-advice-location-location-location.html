    content: Hey...I totally agree!  I'm also on the second floor of 3, though I do have an end apt, so I have one side exposed.  But we have radiator heat that the lanlord pays for, so it's not much of an issue for me in the $$ sense, but it's great to be the creamy center of an oreo cookie!

    content: "This may also sound totally obvious, but check the windows too. As nice as it was in my old apartment to have a huge window in the living room, it had two main problems: 1) south-facing (too hot in the summer), and 2) drafty (too cold in the winter). Last year's November gas bill for the 750 sqft 1-bedroom apt was $80, compared to this year's $50 for a 1100 sqft 2-bedroom 2-storey house with a basement. That's nuts."

    content: "Well I just move in to my apartment and I got one on the 3rd floor and I just had my cheapest gas bill ever with it cold outside $13.49 So all of you promoting the 2nd floor are wrong the 3rd floor is the hot stuff. (In this house we obey the laws of thermodynamics) :) "

<p>In my first installment of <a href="http://veryraw.com/history/2005/06/apartment-hunt-advice/">apartment hunting advice</a> I only shared my observations from the actual hunt.  That was in June though, before I have actually moved into my current place.  Trish and I did a pretty good job we found a place that we like and we haven't had any major problems.  We did however do something right that we had not planned on.  This might be something to keep in mind. </p>
<p>We rented a place on the second floor of a three floor building.  Because we have someone above and below, we only have two exposed sides to our apartment.  We are touched on the other four sides by three apartments and a hallway.  I believe the high for the last two weeks has not gotten much above freezing and we haven't turned our heat on yet. We have electric heat in the apartment.  Souring energy costs are all the rage on the news this winter and I hear people complaining about really high bills because of heat.  We wouldn't know though.  There are nights that I have to put on shorts because our apartment is so warm.</p>
<p>My point here is, no matter where your apartment is in the summer, you are going to use your air conditioner.  But if you can choose an apartment in the center of a building, you'll  save a significant amount of money in the winter.</p>
