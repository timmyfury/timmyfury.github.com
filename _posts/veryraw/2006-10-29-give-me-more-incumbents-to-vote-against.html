      Vati, Vati.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      That\xC3\xA2\xE2\x82\xAC\xE2\x84\xA2s V-A-T-I, with a long \xC3\xA2\xE2\x82\xAC\xCB\x9CA\xC3\xA2\xE2\x82\xAC\xE2\x84\xA2 and long \xC3\xA2\xE2\x82\xAC\xCB\x9CI\xC3\xA2\xE2\x82\xAC\xE2\x84\xA2.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      The present state of America makes me sick. It actually makes me nauseous to ponder how far this once magnificent country has slipped into mediocrity. When I was a young man, fifty years ago, you could mention just about anything: And America was best at that. Now we rarely lead the World in anything. We can still claim one title; America has become the World's Biggest Debtor Nation.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Back then, America enjoyed the best health care, the best schools, and the best working conditions on Earth, while we worked less hours, made more money, and enjoyed a life style never before seen upon this planet.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Our coal mines were producing more coal, our steel-mills smelting more iron, and our assembly-lines led the World in manufacturing beautiful automobiles, refrigerators, wash-machines, dryers, and the hoard of smaller appliances and gadgets (which eliminated most of the drudgery of our daily chores) and introduced us to the life-of-ease, we all now enjoy.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Now, American High School Graduates rank only average (whether tested in Mathematics, World History, Language, Science or any other critical field of expertise) and compared with the test scores of students from other industrialized nations.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Our so-called health care system stinks, it is without question, the most dysfunctional conglomeration of nonsensical laws bureaucrats have ever assembled. It assures illegal aliens and greedy politicians unlimited free health care, while it renders millions of hard \r\n\
      working, honest citizens, incapable of obtaining any kind of health insurance.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      The new Social Security Drug Plan deducts a premium for drug insurance, which you can bet will raise every year, from the social security checks, of subscribers. [AARP just raised my premium from $25.25 to $28.50, a 12.87% raise for 2007.] A great many drugs are not covered by this new plan, and it only pays a maximum of about 70% on any drug, a lot less on most. When the total drug bill (what the retiree and the government pays) reaches $2250.00, Grandma gets cut off, has to pay it all herself, until her total drug bill reaches $3500.00. Obviously if Grandma can not afford her drugs, her bill will never get to $3500.00, so she will go without her drugs for the rest of the year. Of course the monthly premium will still be deducted from her Social Security Check. The drug companies formulated this drug bill, got it enacted, and only the drug companies are going to benefit from it. (Our government gives them the premiums.) In short, this Shaft Our Grandparents Bill is nothing but a multi-million dollar windfall for the drug companies.\r\n\
      \r\n [AARP also broadened the gap between when they quit paying for Grandma\xC3\xA2\xE2\x82\xAC\xE2\x84\xA2s drugs, and when they start paying again. During 2006 they quit paying when the drug cost reach $2250, and restarted at $3600, leaving a $1350 gap. In 2007 the gap will be extended to $1450.] \r\n\
      \r\n\
      The above bill is sure not the worst medical bill our elected officials have ever enacted. It just happens to be the last that made me angry. Hundreds of anti-consumer bills and amendments are on the books, which benefit only the medical and or the drug industries. Foreign competition to American Drug Companies is nonexistent. If it was legitimized, we could import drugs from reputable foreign drug facilities, for as little as 10% of the extortion we are now forced to pay our American Drug Companies.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Sad to say, but the Medical Cartels and Drug Companies, with their unchallenged power, are not the worst villains when it comes to manipulating our government into giving them a license to gouge us. The international oil and gas conglomerates, the \r\n\
      interstate utility companies, railroad cartels, automobile and airplane manufacturing companies, the cable companies, international shipping cartels and a score of other business concerns all wield as much or more power over our Congress, Senate and \r\n\
      President, than the drug companies do. \r\n\
      \r\n\
      Big Business is our real enemy. Big Business controls both our National and State Governments, and Big Business is the real reason America is losing ground on all fronts, the reason America is slowly but steadily slipping into mediocrity.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      The companies mentioned above, along with a score of Countries and a hoard of other mighty forces, funnel billions of dollars annually into Washington, to influence the Republican and Democratic Party Leaders to legislate on their behalf.     \r\n\
      \r\n\
      The leaders of the Democratic and Republican Parties, in the Congress and Senate, now have more control over their subservient Congressman and Senators, than a Marine General has over his troops. The Political Party Lords control the pac-money. And the pac-money is what decides who will get elected, or heaven forbid, smeared. The Political Lords can\xC3\xA2\xE2\x82\xAC\xE2\x84\xA2t just walk down on the floor and tell a congressman or senator that they are fired. But they can have anyone that fails to kowtow to the powers that be, ostracized, and rendered powerless. And by denying pac-money and support, they can keep anyone from being re-elected.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      It is crucial to America's future that we, the voters, acknowledge that the Political Lords are running this country. When all the Republicans vote yea, and all the Democrats vote nay, our Congressman and/or Senators are not voting their conscience, and they sure aren't voting the way we want them to vote. They are voting exactly the way the Party Lords have decreed they vote. And folks that\xC3\xA2\xE2\x82\xAC\xE2\x84\xA2s not Democracy, that\xC3\xA2\xE2\x82\xAC\xE2\x84\xA2s flagrant Bureaucracy. If we are going to declare war, prudence behooves us to first learn all we can about our enemy.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Now, I just pulled what I have written here off the top of my head. So if you find a mistake, don\xC3\xA2\xE2\x82\xAC\xE2\x84\xA2t get excited, it is not that important, the overall theme of this opinion is correct. And furthermore it is also correct that with a minimum of research, anyone can ascertain for themselves that this greatest of all nations, is rapidly slipping into mediocrity.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      And even the United States of America, the greatest nation that ever existed, can fall from within, if we continue to allow misguided politicians, to barter piece after piece of good government away to any group able and willing to pay for preferential treatment.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      I have been telling people for years; when in doubt always vati. But only in this last year has the urge to really push this concept become obligatory.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Actually, voting against the incumbents is a very viable method of straightening out what is wrong with America. The power of our vote is awesome, if used wisely. Many congressmen and senators win their seats by very small margins, less than 5%. So if just 5% of the voters would vati, we would probably retire near a quarter of our Senators and Congressmen. And you can bet we would get their attention. If as many voters vati-ed, as voted for Ross Perot in 1992, we\xC3\xA2\xE2\x82\xAC\xE2\x84\xA2d probably unseat about 75% of both houses. Very few politicians win their seats with an 18.9% margin.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Folks this plan definitely has possibilities. Politician\xC3\xA2\xE2\x82\xAC\xE2\x84\xA2s egos are all wrapped up in their positions. Actually the only thing in the World, politicians love more than pac-money, is their influential positions, their jobs. And on the very day our legislators learn that their electorate is actually threatening to vote them out of office, they are going to be magically stricken with a burning desire to legislate on behave of their constituency.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      The only question left is, where are you going to place your loyalty, to the Political Parties that you have been blindly supporting, or to America? You can\xC3\xA2\xE2\x82\xAC\xE2\x84\xA2t serve two \r\n\
      masters, and be loyal to both. We have to take the power away from the Party Lords; to the extent that it allows our elected representatives to vote the way we tell them to vote. Or in thirty years you are not going to be able to tell the difference between Washington and the corrupt Government of Mexico, or for that matter, tell the difference between America and Mexico.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      I wrote this poem more than twenty years ago, and it reverberates my sentiment now as vibrantly, as then.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      VATI VATI\r\n\
      \r\n\
      As Mighty Rome Fell, America Could Die.\r\n\
      Whether It Falls Or Not, Is Up To You And I.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      I worried and stewed, but by-and-by,\r\n\
      came up with a plan, where you and I,\r\n\
      can put America the a road, to a brand-new high.\r\n\
      Just blame the politicians, get blood in your eye,\r\n\
      and vote against the incumbents. Vati, vati.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Now just voting won't do it, we've got to vati.\r\n\
      That's  v, a, t, i, with a long \"A\", and  long \"I.\"\r\n\
      Vote Against The Incumbents, and you vati.\r\n\
      Things will never get better, until we vati.\r\n\
      Vote against the incumbents, Vati, vati.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      There is no time, to just set and sigh.\r\n\
      America will fail, without you and I.\r\n\
      The time has come, we must do or die.\r\n\
      We must all vote, and we must vati.\r\n\
      Vote against the incumbents, Vati, vati.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Things won't just get better, by-and-by.\r\n\
      Unless the apathetic voters, you and I,\r\n\
      hit those poles with blood in our eye.\r\n\
      And not only vote, but wisely vati,\r\n\
      Vote against the incumbent. Vati, vati.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      We must not buy, some political lie,\r\n\
      the America we love, is about to die.\r\n\
      Politicians no longer, serve you and I,\r\n\
      but all acquiesce, to the powers that buy.\r\n\
      Vote against the incumbents. Vati, vati.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      The newly elected may want to serve you and I,\r\n\
      until that powerful pac-money catches their eye.\r\n\
      Then party loyalty becomes, their big lie.\r\n\
      As they vote with the Pac, for their piece of the pie.\r\n\
      Vote against the incumbents, Vati, vati.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Congressmen and Senators are nigh as apt to die,\r\n\
      as meet defeat at the poles, by you and I.\r\n\
      They know we\xC3\xA2\xE2\x82\xAC\xE2\x84\xA2ll vote for\xC3\xA2\xE2\x82\xAC\xE2\x84\xA2em, they don\xC3\xA2\xE2\x82\xAC\xE2\x84\xA2t have to try.\r\n\
      America is declining, as democracy goes awry.\r\n\
      Vote against the incumbent. Vati, vati.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Waxing fat on the apathy, shown by you and I,\r\n\
      politicians became hogs, and Washington's a sty.\r\n\
      But we can change all that, in the blink of an eye,\r\n\
      if we just get off our apathy, and dutifully vati.\r\n\
      Vote against the incumbents. Vati, vati.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      If just one out of twenty, of us would vati,\r\n\
      we*d get nigh a forth of that Washington sty.\r\n\
      Now that might he to few, to help you and I,\r\n\
      But we\xC3\xA2\xE2\x82\xAC\xE2\x84\xA2d darn sure make, the rest of them shy.\r\n\
      Vote against the incumbents. Vati, vati.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      And when; \"Foul, foul,\" the politicians cry.\r\n\
      And charge that; \"great careers will sadly die.\"\r\n\
      Stand up and look them, straight in the eye,\r\n\
      And vow; \"Losing only makes the truly-great try.\"\r\n\
      Vote against the incumbents. Vati, vati.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      From the County Coroner, to that Washington sty,\r\n\
      if you don\xC3\xA2\xE2\x82\xAC\xE2\x84\xA2t love the incumbent, always vati.\r\n\
      Help turn America toward, a brand-new high.\r\n\
      Teach your kids and your friends, they must vati.\r\n\
      Vote against the incumbents. Vati, vati.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      If the state of America, makes you want to cry,\r\n\
      then help start a revolution, no one has to die.\r\n\
      Our party loyalty sent elections go so far awry.\r\n\
      And we can fix that error, just revolt and vati.\r\n\
      Vote against the incumbents. Vati, vati.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Part your 2nd and 3rd finger; that \"v\" means vati.\r\n\
      Send this to a friend, who you think will comply.\r\n\
      Let\xC3\xA2\xE2\x82\xAC\xE2\x84\xA2s all band together and give'em a black eye.\r\n\
      Vati, vati, and hearty bye-bye.\r\n\
      \r\n\

As if you thought they didn't get more important than the 2004 presidential elections, this year comes out of nowhere and slaps you in the face like you're an enemy combatant in questioning in Guantanamo Bay.  With a third of the Senators and every single Congressmen up for re-election, this election year is the equivalent to the 2000 and 2004 election years combined for the legislative branch.  At heart I am a social progressive, I'm a fiscal conservative, you might call me a true democrat.  Lower taxes and increase social programs (as if).  I would love to be able to say that I wanted democrats to take control of Congress, but I can't! There is so much fluff and bullshit on both sides of the government that I throw up a little bit in my mouth every time I think about that fateful Tuesday in November when at least 2 members of Congress expect me to hand them another couple of years to tool around with my country.  There are more scandels than I care to mention.  Worst of all though is that Congress has been handing President Bush power that is unrivaled by the government of <em>1984</em>.  After the FBI recently invaded the home of a man who created a program to <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/10/29/ceci_nest_pas_un_fak.html">make fake boarding passes</a>.  After a bill is signed giving Goerge Bush the authority to declare Marshall Law on our own people.  After Congress has allowed George Bush to declare anyone <a href="http://mobones.mcelaney.com/?p=27">a criminal without telling them why</a>.  It's time to transition the government to a different group of people.  

The current government isn't doing what the American people need them to do.  We need to vote against every single incumbent regardless of what they are currently doing.  My barber has a great opinion on polititians.  After the promises, the first year in office is for the people.  The rest of them are for themselves.  

I'm voting Casey, I'm voting Sestak.  Regardless of policy.  I may not agree with everything that the challengers are saying, but for fucksake we couldn't do any worse than we are doing now.
