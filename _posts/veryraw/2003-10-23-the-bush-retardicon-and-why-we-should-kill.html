<p>Terri Schaivo needs to die.  She has no dignity left.  The feeding tube was pulled a week ago and now they are going to give it back.  This move is based on Jeb Bush's order.  Once again a bush shows how truly fucking retarded and uneducated they are.  Right wing radio stations, newspapers and websites across the country are hailing this "humanitarian"; move to save a woman who has been all but dead for 13 years.  You can read how moronic these <a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=351 58">implements</a> of the uneducated look for yourself.  I'd rather not go into that particular article because it makes me madder (and I mean mad in the literal insane sense) then the growing exploitation of the minority black population by the black politician.  Fact of the matter is that the parents of Schaivo are hanging onto something that isn't there.  The tape that they have been spreading around which fooled Jeb (the name says it all) into thinking that she is still "alive" contains a woman doing things characteristic of anyone in a persistent vegetable state.  Staring at her mother, only because her mother was in the path of the stare, and smiling, a reflex of the muscles controlled by the brain stem which consequently is just about the only part of her brain that isn't hollowed out and filled with brain fluid.</p>
<p>Terri Shaivo's parents should have their feeding tubes pulled too.  Oh yeah and Jeb Bush, you are as much a brain-dead retard as your father your brother and Terri Schaivo.  The picture above was a doodle from a meeting at work.  I post it today in honor of right wing America.</p>
