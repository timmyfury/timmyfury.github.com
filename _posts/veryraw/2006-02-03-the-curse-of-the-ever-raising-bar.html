      I think someone is hinting that I should quit my job. 
      
      Jesus should stop beating around the bush and just say it already. I mean you already said it and you don't even have that whole "son of god" thing going for you.
      
      I am breaking up with Jesus.

I have spent a lot of time over the past year searching for some kind of inspiration.  Some pop, zing or rise.  I've been left high and dry for most of it.  At some point I believe most of the things I have been working on became very similar to each other.  There was nothing new to learn.  I shouldn't say there was nothing new, I should say those particular projects have been so similar that they haven't involved anything I haven't done before.

When I first got into web development, I was learning 400 new things a day.  Everything was new because I knew nothing.  As my skills and my knowledge of the tools I was using grew, the frequency of the <em>a-ha</em> moment was less frequent.  Every subsequent project becomes less exciting and soon I start to feel like I am canning tuna on an assembly line.  Everything is the same.  Nothing is special.

<strong>This is the curse of the ever raising bar.</strong>

I thought for a long time that this was just my lack of interest in my field of choice.  I thought that maybe I had outgrown my profession already.  Recently though I picked up a few new technology books.  They were skills that I had thought about picking up for a long time but had never carried through on.  I started reading and there it was - the excitement.  It was back and raging like never before.  

These new exciting skills have turned into new ideas for new projects.  Some of which I will actually execute, other I will not.  Regardless, this curse surely applies to most professions.  The important thing is to identify it and prevent yourself from giving up on the profession altogether.  When the curse jumps up and gets you, maybe its time to learn something new, try something different or just move on to the next place.
