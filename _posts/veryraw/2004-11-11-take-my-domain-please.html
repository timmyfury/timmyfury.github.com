<blockquote>
Dear Valued Go Daddy Customer,<br />

Effective November 12, 2004, ICANN, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, will put in place its new transfer policy for all accredited domain name service providers.<br />

The previous ICANN policy allowed us to deny requests to transfer your domain names to another registrar unless you explicitly confirmed to us your intent to transfer. The new ICANN policy removes that protection. When we receive a request to transfer your domain name to a new registrar, we will still attempt to contact you to confirm that you authorized the request. However, if you do not respond, or are not able to respond within 5 days, your domain name WILL be transferred.<br />

Rest assured, your domains have NOT been transferred, and IT IS UNLIKELY that this will happen.
</blockquote>

<p>Although <a href="http://iam.thecolossus.net">Mark</a> has stated how stupid this policy is, I disagree.  I have many times, particularly when I was looking for a new <acronym title="Universal Resource Locator">URL</acronym> for my blog, ran into a case where the site wasn't doing anything but it was still registered. I wish I had saved the names of those sites for this exact circumstance.  My thought is that this policy has been changed at ICANN to help recover some of these <acronym title="Universal Resource Locator">URL</acronym>'s if they are wanted by someone else.  I think I am going to start trying to steal people's domains. You know... just for fun.
