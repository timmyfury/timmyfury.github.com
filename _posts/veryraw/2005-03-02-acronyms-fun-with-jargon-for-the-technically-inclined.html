Michael, <a href="http://iam.thecolossus.net/">Mark</a> and I were talking about great acronyms for technology systems.  Two of Michael's favorites are Digital Asset Management System (DAM) and Project Management System (PMS).  Conversation takes a turn for the worst and we come up with these further examples of wonderful systems.

<ul>
<li>Standard Hub of Internet Technology System</li>
<li>Closed Unification Network Terminal</li>
<li>Asset Sorting System</li>
</ul>

<acronym title="Standard Hub of Internet Technology System">SHITS</acronym> is an example of a <acronym title="Closed Unification Network Terminal">CUNT</acronym> which allows you to access your <acronym title="Asset Sorting System">ASS</acronym>.

I'll leave it up to y'all to take it too far.
