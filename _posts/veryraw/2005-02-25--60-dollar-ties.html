    content: "yeah, your absoultely right, but i dont agree with the fact that no one notices your shirts. pants, you can get away with cheap, they're usually a drab color that goes with pretty much anything. but a nice shirt rocks, less wrinkles, the collar stays straight and it fits well rather than too big(which i find is the problem with most shirts). you have a point about the ties though, a nice tie is the detail that says, \"yeah i spend lots of money on useless things so i can look good\" "

    content: I agree on the ties. You get what you pay for. However, I feel differently that you about footwear. I _do not_ believe in cheap shoes. When I buy footwear, I'm in it for the long haul. I have shoes/boots for years. Italian shoes and boots are worth every freakin' dime you will spend on them. And trust me, people look at your shoes. I'm changing jobs in two weeks, and will be having to dress nicer. Now it's jeans and boots and t-shirts, there it will be "business casual", as much as I hate that term. So I'll be right there with ya, buddy. Um, except for the ties.

    content: "I think you can get away with the same effect with a tie in the $30 - $45 dollar range. Where do you find your $60 dollar ties? I agree with Burn on the shirts. Nobody wants to see man tits, you need a quality shirt, none of that really thin material. "

    content: "I should restate some of the things I said there.  The comments on being able to spare expense other places was just to emphasize the importance of quality ties.  My shirts fall in the $30-$50 range, and the last pair of pants I bought ran me $80.  A nice little hit to the purse.  \r\n\
      \r\n\
      As far as shoes go, you can get nice looking shoes for pretty low price.  I don't buy cheap shoes either though.  The importance of shoes lies less in appearance (although still important) and more in comfort.  I <strong>cannot</strong> where uncomfortable shoes.  It's like the worst kind of torture.  "

A few months ago I wrote about <a href="http://veryraw.com/history/2005/01/my-promotion/">my most recent promotion</a>.  The results of this on my life have been amazing.  Trish has noted many times since how little I bitch about my job now.  The frustration level is so long in my new position that its more of a pleasure than a pain to go to work.  

One of the differences between this job and the previous is that I am no longer crawling around on floors.  I'm either at my desk or meeting with people about projects that we are working on.  There is little physical exertion (outside of lifting my coffee cup).  So I have started to "dress for success".  That means shirt and tie - every day. I'm actually enjoying it too.  I've been buying new stuff pretty consistantly.  To a fault actually, I spend nearly my entire paycheck every two weeks now on shirts and ties and pants and shoes.  

The reason I mention this is because I have made one very important observation.  Take this to heart men.  If you are buying ties, you may not think that there is a difference between a $15  and a $60 tie, but there is.  When you tie a $15 tie, it may look alright at first but by the end of the day you have a tight knot at your neck.  Looks alright but not as good as it did when you first put it on.   When you tie a $60 tie, you get a nice meaty knot.  At the end of the day you still have that meaty knot.  The tie looks exactly the same at the end of the day.

So don't spare expense on your ties.  You can get cheap shoes, pants and shirts if your budget doesn't warrant expensive clothes.  You will still look good.  People don't notice these things.  People always notice your tie.  If you cheap out on your ties, everyone will know that you cheaped out on your ties.
