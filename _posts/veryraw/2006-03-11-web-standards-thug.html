<p>This one may be a little nerdy for most of your tastes, but I thought I would share it regardless. I've had this sign for a while.  It was originally used for a white elephant at work.  Nothing quite like taken stolen materials to the work christmas party.  It bounced around a little bit in the school.  People stealing it from each other's offices and eventually ended up back in my hands.  So I stenciled some web standards nerdery onto it and its going back into my office.  The days of the internet jerk from the late 90's are gone.  Now its the time of the Web Standards Thug.</p>
