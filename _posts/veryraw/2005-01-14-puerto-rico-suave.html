<p>I don't know how many of you know but Debbie left this morning for four and a half months in San Jaun, Puerto Rico.  She's gonna be continuing her studies in Spanish and hot sweaty Latino men.  Before she left I set her up with a blog so we can all be kept abreast to what she is doing.  So visit <a href="http://debra.veryraw.com/">Debbie's Blog</a>.  Leave her a message.</p>
