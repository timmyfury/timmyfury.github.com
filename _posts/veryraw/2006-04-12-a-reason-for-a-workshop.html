<p>A few weeks ago <a href="http://iam.thecolossus.net">Mark</a> and I were discussing <del>owning a home</del> reasons to purchase a home... individually... without the involvement of each other... in any way.  I want to buy a house so I can set up a workshop.  We really couldn't think of any practical reasons to have a workshop though since I don't do any carpentry or anything.  Well I think I may have something.</p>
<p>I have always been fascinated by chain reaction displays.  There is one at <a href="http://www.fi.edu">The Franklin Institute</a> that I could watch for hours.  Check this one out, <a href="http://www.pistolwimp.com/media/44210/">Incredible Machines</a>.  Seems like a good hobby to take up.  Combines physics, little bit of engineering, creativity, tinkering and gives you a reason to buy toys and build up a solid collection of junk.</p>
