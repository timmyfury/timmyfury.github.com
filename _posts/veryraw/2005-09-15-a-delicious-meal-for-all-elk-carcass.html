      I had to investigate Anal Douche, I don't know why, I just had this urge to click on it to find out what it was....
      This is a review taken from Anal Douche by Doc Johnson:
      Reviewer:    davelog "davelog" (Phoenix. AZ USA) -  
      Works as advertised, no complaints. I do, however, need to find some very heavy-duty paper towels. Now. 
      
      LOL!

"Elk Carcass" sounds  horrible.  Why would you advertise that way. Mark responded with "gah", a very appropropriate response.</p>
<p>The reviews are even better though.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Out of all the carcasses I have eaten (And believe me....I try to treat myself to carcass at LEAST once a month) this is by far the freshest and most tasty. Fans of carcasses will be pleased that you no longer have to scrape these tasty tidbits from the roadside...alas no more trying to grill out those tire marks....no sir-ee Now everybodys favorite online bookstore brings carcass out of the interstate and right to your dinnerplate!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Flavorful flavorful flavorful. And stimulates a euphoria not unlike what I imagine controlled substances to be like--most particularly those dispensed by one Alan Owlsley in in the 60s. I bought a used one, which may have something to do with these extremely colorful flash-forwards I've been having since hosting a dinner party for 18, of Elk Tartar. Still, you can't go wrong with elk. Even the used ones pack a wallop you won't soon forget. In fact, I'd argue that ESPECIALLY the used ones will make you the "life of the party." </p>

<blockquote>
<p>While it is not quite the whole carcass (no antlers, hoofs or fur) it's still a great bargain. And when I'm having carcass, I like to have oranges with my carcass, and maybe a little fruity zinfandel to wash down the carcass. The health benefits cannot be overstated, considering the impact this will have on your food budget. No more Krispy Kremes.</p>
<p>By the way, this makes a Great wedding gift. what an impression you will make! </p>
