      gotta love people like mark:  if you don't share their taste in music your taste "fucking blows" evidently.
      
      he reminds of people i've met on occasion: people that go around digging up obscure bands so that they can see the bewildered look on others' faces who make inquiry.  these are the same people who are invariably heard saying things like "they're sell-outs" or "i only like their old stuff" if a band they listen do DOES make it big.
      
      personally, i think linkin park and incubus are both good bands.  mark might call me a conformist, but i just have a hard time denying good music when i hear it, regardless of the source.  i noticed the san francisco symphony recently did some linkin park arrangements.  evidently, mark is so musically accomplished as to see some ghastly inadequacy in linkin park that a backyard operation such as the san francisco symphony was incapable of perceiving.  yeah, that's pretty typical.
      
      nice site, man.

      Uh, dude, Tim doesn't actually have any Linkin Park or Incubus on his iPod or his computer, because he thinks they suck.
      
      I like how you made an assumption about me by using the old "they remind me of this type of people" so you can bail out of it later by saying that "you didn't actually say I was like that." You probably don't like people <em>like</em> black people, but you never really said you didn't like black people so your not a racist right? 
      
      As for my musical taste, it fucking rules. Theres no question or comment to be made about it. Theres nothing under the sun I won't listen to, and nothing I have encountered that I have made a snap judgement about that I wasn't willing to retract. Whether a band is popular or not has nothing to do with the quality of their music. I like a lot of pop. 
      
      Just a note a symphony play what is paid to to play. Additionally, I see your stuck in that "Hey, check it out it's classical music but it's still rock and roll! This rules and legitimizes my taste! Nothing is musically more relevant and interesting than classical!" Classical music is not the epitome of music, and what more a symphony plays what it is told and paid to play. Someone wanted to hear Linkin Park arranged for symphony orchestra, big deal. 
      
      Long and short I like Linkin Park well enough, their fans need to rot in hell, Incubus still sucks dick. 
      
      Conformist.

    content: Incubus does suck.  It will never be on my iPod, computer or even my trashcan.  As for Linkin Park, Most of their stuff blows too.  Unlike Mark, I can't really tolerate them.  Mark's the person that introduced me to most of the music that I listen to today.  We have nearly identical taste in music.  If you don't like what we like, your taste in music fucking blows.

      wow, i'm glad i swung back by here.  talk about tag-teamed.  oof.
      
      actually, mark, saying you reminded me of others i've met was intended to suggest exactly the opposite: that i could NOT make such an assumption about you (hell yeah it was meant to let me bail!)  it provided a segue to allow me to further comment on people i HAVE come to know.  that's not to say that "these people" (you seemed fond of that phrase) are bad people, either.
      
      ugh. had to play the race card, eh?
      
      i'm glad to have read your post, actually, and to see i likely ill-spoke; it serves me right for stumbling upon a single line in a blog and responding reactively to it without looking around more.  i don't know, it just rubbed me the wrong way, i guess; here was this guy stopping by someone's blog and giving him hell for the music he listened to.  it crossed my mind i could be wrong, thus the aforementioned "bail;" but such is a prime example of why i've taken an interest in blogs, as of late.
      
      well, that's it for me.  funny...i stumbled upon this site while googling "ibrick."  that's what my buddy calls his ibook for some unknown reason and i was wondering if there was any online basis for that; i didn't find any.  anyway, take care, guys.

<p>Thursday night I installed a <acronym title="Virtual Private Network">VPN</acronym> client on my computer at home to connect to the web servers  at work.  After installation I was asked to restart and I complied.</p>
<p>When the box came back up iTunes opened and my stomach dropped as I read, "iTunes can not read iPod "Mr. Bojangles". Use iPod restore utility to restore your iPod back to original factory settings.</p>
<h4>Houston, we have a problem!</h4>
<p>A big freaking problem.  I restored it to original factory settings with the iPod software and afterwards it was stuck in file storage mode.  A trip to the Apple store and it worked on the Mac we attached it to.  Bring it home and nothing again. Symantec, what the fuck have you done to my iPod.  I have just uninstalled practically everything from my computer that I don't use.  This includes iTunes the iPod updating software and that heaping pile of shit Symantic calls a <acronym title="Virtual Private Network">VPN</acronym> client.  I have restarted and I will now reinstall iTunes and the the iPod software.  Then I will try re-attaching the iPod to my computer. </p>
<p>If this doesn't work you may hear about it on the news. update in few minutes...</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> In the words of Ben Franklin, "iPod is proof that there is a god and he wants us to be happy."  It worked.  I am currently loading my music back onto my iPod.  A process that took me over a week the first time.  I'm glad it worked.  I didn't feel like killing tonight.</p>
