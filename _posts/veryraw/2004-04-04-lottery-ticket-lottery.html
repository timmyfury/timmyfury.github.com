The other day I helped my father and mother move my older sister into her new house.  My father and I took off work to do so and my Mom and Dad were hapy that I helped because they aren't exactly in the proper shape to lug heavy boxes up and down stairs.  It took us all day because my sister didn't have anything packed.

We get home and my father says, "We know you don't have to help us but we really appreciate it.  And we let you live here and all that nice stuff so it's nice that you pay us back in favors.  And I know I don't have to do anything to repay you but I feel it would be nice."

So he lays four lottery tickets out on the table.  There were three scratch and win and one pick your numbers tickets.

"All four of these tickets have a dollar value.  You may pick one.  you get to keep the one you pick.  But you are stuck with it once you pick it."

So I sit and agonize over which one to pick. I was inclined to pick the one that was a pick-your-numbers ticket but after about five minutes I chose one of the three dollar scratch and wins.

I look at the ticket and its the most complicated ticket ever.  He looks over my shoulder and says, "Thats the ninety dollar ticket."

"Sweet. What were the others worth?"

"Twenty-five, thirty-five, and twenty-one."

What luck.  I picked the good ticket.  So anyway he says to me, "You see Tim, sometimes when you gamble - you lose."
