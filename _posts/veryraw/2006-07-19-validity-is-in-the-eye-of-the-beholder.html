      Exactly. And like you said, it's important to keep in mind that the web is a constantly-evolving medium, so no page is ever "finished," like a print piece is finished.
      
      Some developers work tirelessly to make sure their code is perfect (according to them): standards-compliant, using best practices, etc - and what happens is the job takes twice as long to complete, because the developer is pouring over irrelevant details, such as if it's valid to include a list item inside a blockquote. (stupid example, but you get the idea).
      
      The client doesn't care about that stuff - they just want their page to "work."
      
      I've struggled with debating whether I should take the time to make sure everything is as "standards compliant" and "best practiced" and "usable" as can be - and sometimes it takes so long, I just do whatever gets the job done.
      '
      I tell myself I can always go back later, when I have more time, and make the page more compliant, etc.

<p>This entry was prompted by Brian's entry about <a href="http://www.bittermonk.com/2006/07/17/canned-content-management/">bad canned content management systems</a>, which was prompted by his frustration with said systems.  What follows is a recycled email I sent to a friend who shall remain nameless.  He was working on his master degree and had built a site to assist his students.  Basic site with a calendar and some downloadable stuff for his students to help them practice.  He asked me for my opinion about his site from a standards compliance point of view.  I needed to point out to him a few things about the idea of standards compliance.</p>
<p>The significance of this recycled content, my response to my unnamed friend is that there is no catch all for every situation.  Whether you are talking about standards compliance or content management solutions, there's an almost right and a lot of wrongs in every situation.  The key is to pick the right almost right solution.</p>
<p><em>The passage has been edited a bit to make myself look like a slightly less illiterate baffoon, and to remove any mention of the aforementioned friend.</em></p>
<blockquote title="An email sent to a friend">
<p>Standards Compliance is kind of a nebulous idea.  The term is thrown around pretty freely in the industry and has lost some of the punch it used to have.  To be standards compliant, you have to select a standard (html,xhtml,xml) and a level of that standard to follow.  If you were to use a standard such as HTML4.0 (a completely respectable standard) you could consider your site completely compliant.  You are currently using the HTML4 frameset standard (also known as a doctype) and you are using it properly.  Your site is completely standards compliant.</p>
<p>A concept that has a little more weight and significance is "adherance to best practices".  When you adhere to best practices...</p>
<ul>
<li>you are not only making sure your site is compliant with your selected standard,</li>
<li>but you also make sure that your markup is semantically constructed (in otherwords you use tags for what they are meant to be used for, tables for tabular data, headings for headings, lists for lists),</li>
<li>you provide meaningful and useful content in a way that is written to be consumed on the web (seperated into subheadings and lists) because information is digested differently in print and on the web.</li>
<li>and you take accessibility into account.  Accessibility for not only for those of special need but also for those who use use mobile devices or those who would just prefer to print your information and read it on the hopper.</li>
<li>and last but not least you seperate content(html), presentation(css), and behavior(javascript). </li>
</ul>
<p>This may sound like a lot, but its all easily achievable.  The web standards movement (not to be confused with standards compliance) is about best practises through use of the 3 layers of seperation (mentioned above) and a little planning and contiousness of what you are doing. </p>
<p>In the end though, it comes down to a few things...</p>
<ul>
<li>amount of time you have to pour over content to make it "compliant"</li>
<li>will best practices make your cool thing not as cool (are you stiffling creativity to achieve something that the next guy could say you didn't achieve because his definition of best practices is different than yours)</li>
<li>and what is your definition of best practices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Practically speaking though, this approach makes modifying your work a lot easier and takes a lot of strain off of you.  And you also have to keep in mind that my field is easily one of the most rapidly evolving you could pick.  Furthermore, this isn't like print or presentations or flyers.  If its not right today you can make it better tomorrow.  Bottom line, if your product achieves what you intend it to achieve then its not wrong. </p></blockquote>
