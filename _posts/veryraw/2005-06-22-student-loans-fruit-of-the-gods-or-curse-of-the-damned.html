Research and opinion
 
	Student loans have become a large part of the college experience for youth across America.  Enrollment at collegesâ€™ country wide rises every year and tuition costs follow suit.  Student loans help many students make it through college.  What effect do these loans have on a student when they are planning and paying for their education?
	A little background on student loans is needed before this question can be answered.  There are two loan programs available.  The first is the William D. Ford loan; the money for these loans comes from the government.  The second program is called the Federal Family Education Loan.  The money for these loans comes from lending institutions and is guaranteed by the federal government.  Each of these programs has two types of loans.  There are subsidized, which are based on financial need, and unsubsidized.  Students who receive subsidized loans do not begin accruing interest until they have been out of school for at least 6 months.  For those who are not in financial distress, unsubsidized loans begin accruing interest as soon as they receive money. (Student Guide, pp.1-13)
	â€œAn American Council of Education study found â€¦between 1994 and 2000, funds utilized for student loans increased from a total of $24.7 to $31.6 million dollars representing an increase of 27% over the period.â€ (Manton)  The average amount borrowed by 62 graduates who participated in a survey at Texas A&M $10,975.40.  40% of those who participated said they would not have been able to complete their schooling without student loans and 61% felt that it would have been difficult to complete their program but they could have made it through.(Manton)
	The purpose of the study was to find out whether students, if given a chance to go back, would change the amount of money they borrowed for school. The study showed â€œthat a significant percentage of the graduates would borrow less if given another opportunity to do so.â€ (Manton) Some would have borrowed the same amount and very few students who participated would have borrowed more money.  This shows that students do not necessarily believe that college is worth a life of debt post-graduation.
	To make matters worse the cost of college tuition has gone up â€œ43% at private colleges and 49% at public institutions since 1992.â€ (â€œDegrees of Debtâ€)  Student aid has not grown with the cost of education.  The highest amount that a student can borrow is still only $23,000.  Kiplingerâ€™s Personal Finance published that studentâ€™s are relying more on credit cards and private lenders to pay for school.  This makes paying back student loans difficult after graduation due to other expenses amounted during school.
	This leads us to a growing default rate on student loans.  After nine years of falling default rates on student loans, â€œthe default rate climbed to 5.9 percent for the fiscal year of 2000, up from 5.6 percent the year before.â€ (Cavanagh)  Higher tuition costs have contributed to this rise.  According to Education Department data, â€œaverage student loan debt rose to $16,928 in 1999-2000, almost twice the amount as eight years before.â€ (Cavanagh)  The federal government is afraid that this trend will continue.  They are pushing schools to counsel their students in debt management and expect schools to push there students to pay loans back on time.  Some school have been penalized for having high default rates by banning students at those school from borrowing money at all.

	Penalties for default are not going to solve the problem of the financial end of the American higher education system.  If the federal government is worried about the condition of the student loan programs, perhaps it is time for reform.  This reform needs to come from two separate directions.  
	The first group that needs to reform their systems is the schools themselves.  The United States puts a lot of emphasis on education at every level.  College is a necessary part of life.  Education is paramount for someone who wants to further their career.  With this knowledge universities have students in a position that they cannot avoid.  Students do not have much of a choice but to pay.  The universities need to lower the costs of education.  If lowering costs is out of the question then opportunities must be offered to balance the costs.  The rise in tuition costs should be slowed considerably as well.
	The Universities are not the only organization who is to blame for the debt of students.  The federal government must reform the program.  The ceiling of borrowing should be raise to eliminate the need to use credit cards and private lenders to pay for school.  If students have fewer loans outside of the government sponsored programs they are more likely to pay their loans back.
	Second, the federal government must lean on the educational institutions to lower their tuition costs.  Furthermore more free money should be given to students directly.  Corporations could be offered special tax benefits for helping employees pay off their loans when they start working.  Interest rates could also be lowered or interest eliminated altogether on student loans.
	Students face a future of debt greater then those who never attend college.  College costs mount and become hard to pay back after graduation.  Reform is needed from multiple players in the college game to save college-goers from the curse of the damned and show them that college can offer them the fruits of the gods.
