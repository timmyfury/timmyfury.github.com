</p><p>As all of you know I am obsessed with <a href="http://www.wawa.com/">Wawa</a>. I drink at least two cups of Wawa coffee everyday and only buy Wawa gas. It has recently come to my attention that they are building three Wawa's within reach of my normal trek to and from work and to and from Trish's house in West Grove. This is good news for me due to my aforementioned obsession. regardless I am curious of what the Wawa business model looks like. I offer my illustration.</p>
