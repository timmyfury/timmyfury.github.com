<p>Hey ya'll, I have just soft launched my newest design.  I call it Iteration Four: Two Gradient Column Watoosy.</p>
<p>Everything is theoretically functional but you never do know do you.  I am working out some bugs in the administrative pages that I have running.  In addition there are a bunch of things missing that need to be here.</p>
<p>I have a ton of ideas for expansion and this new design lets me do that without shitting up the structure of the page.</p>
<p>Notice that I have added a section on the menu called "Meanderings."  This is where I will post the pages that I visit that I think you should see.  Then there is the "Recent Comments" section of the menu which will allows you to see if there are any comments that you haven't seen.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think.</p>
