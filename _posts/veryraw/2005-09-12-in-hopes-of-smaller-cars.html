    content: Timmy, nice to see the turn towards conservation/environmentalism lately.  I recall the littering ticket of a few years back...

    content: Hybrid cars are the ultimate geek vehicle man. It only makes sense in your increasingly geeky self to want one. Go look at the inside of the <a href="http://www.toyota.com/prius/features.html" rel="nofollow">Prius</a> with its lcd screen that shows the status of fuel usage and engine stats, you will be in love. The thing is bluetoothed for christs sake.... i am so getting one soon, gonna trade in my current car for it.... sooo sexy.

    content: You can't get a Jeep Wrangler before me... that would be totally unfair... unless you let me ride in it once in a while, then I guess it's all good.  Anyway, you and trish should come check out my place, it's snazzy

<p>With oil prices pushing ever higher and the impending gloom of <a href="http://www.lifeaftertheoilcrash.net/">peak oil</a>, I wonder how the relative size of American cars will be effected (<a href="http://media.skoopy.com/misc/minicars/">Check out these photoshoped images of the future of vehicles</a>).   The big SUVs and trucks aren't really fun anymore if it costs you too much to drive them.  I am hoping these will die a fast death.  The same people who drive them are the same people who think that 1 inch of clearance is enough when you are passing a biker at 70 mph.</p>
<p>I want a new car. Not a new used car, a new car. Until now the idea was out of my reach because of my driving history.  As of March when my insurance renews again I will be three years without a ticket or an accident and I will turn 26 in April.  So my insurance will be lower and buying a new car becomes doable.</p>
<p>If you have had a conversation with me about anything lately you will probably hear me rant about sustainability or conservation or something of the like.  I've added a bunch of environment/sustainability related blogs to my daily reading and enjoy getting myself worked up about all the possible doomsday scenerios. Two years ago I would have wanted a really big, fast, roaring vehicle.  In fact I <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/timmyfury/21032900/">sold two such cars</a> a little over a year ago and downsized engine size. At the beginning of the summer I rented a Toyota Corolla while I was vacationing in Florida.  Four cylinders of pure joy turned me to the dark side of the economy car.  I drove the car nearly 400 miles and at the end of the week when I refilled the tank (the only refill of the week) it cost me 12 dollars.  Yeah that's hot.</p>
<p>All these facts combined have pushed me into thinking that I could step down once again and get me a nice four cylinder or a sweet trendy hybrid.  If they come out with a hybrid Jeep Wrangler, I am so getting one.</p>
