	There were about thirty of us standing outside of a theater at about 3a.m. after a long, late movie.   It was commonplace for us to stand outside of the theater after a movie.  These werenâ€™t your usual early twenties individuals.  These were the sort of people that would drink maple syrup so they could throw it up and cause a chain reaction of vomiting.  These were the sort of people that would steal your keys when you passed out at a party and drive your car onto your front lawn and leave you asleep at the wheel.  These were the sort of people who would start a international hacker organization, recruit thousands of people worldwide, plaster their own website with racist propaganda and report themselves to the anti-defamation league.  They did these things all in the name of fun.  These werenâ€™t normal people.  They were straight up hooligans.
	I was standing in the middle of this rabble getting colder and colder.  It was the dead of winter but we all still insisted on standing there trying to figure out what we were going to do knowing full well there was nothing to do at 3a.m.  I leaned over to my girlfriend and whispered into her ear something that every girl longs to hear from her boyfriend.  â€œDrive-by?â€
	â€œRace you to the car,â€ she whispered back as she started to sprint through the empty parking lot toward my beat up old Chevy.   My car was fondly referred to by my friends as the â€œanimulâ€ (Lumina backwards).  The things we had done to that car would turn my mothers face white if she knew, luckily she wasnâ€™t there.
	We arrived at the car and jumped in.  As I started the engine, she pulled my semi-automatic paintball gun out from under my front seat.  I jammed the car into reverse and chirped out of my parking spot.  My friends looked up at me as I slammed the car into drive and they scattered.  They knew what was about to happen.  By the time I pulled up to where they had been standing just seconds before they were already jumping into their cars and replaying the scene that Trish and I had perform.  I rolled up next to my friend Ricky and he dove in the back seat of the car.  He pulled his paint-ball gun out from beneath his seat and we sped off into the direction of the other cars in the upper part of the parking lot.  
	There were five other cars with us that night.  They all had at least four people in them. Most of these people had paintball guns with them as well.   We passed them traveling at about 75 mph.  They were still climbing into the cars and as we passed Ricky and Trish sprayed their windshields with paintballs.  When we had pulled about fifty yards past them I ripped my wheel around and the back end of my car spun out and we zoomed in the other direction, heading back to where they were sitting.  
	While I spun my car around they started to pull out of their spots.  They were already firing on each other from close range.  They went in five different directions and started pulling maneuvers like I had.  Dodging light posts, narrowly missing head-on collisions and spinning donuts in the parking lot, we toyed with death like it was a flame on a match.  My car was hit with about 300 paintballs and we all decided we would meet at the local diner for coffee before we went in.  Four of the cars pulled away and I remained behind and talked to my friend Code who was driving the sixth car.  
	We werenâ€™t paying attention as we talked because two security trucks pulled up to our cars.  One pulled in front of our cars.  The other pulled behind us.  We couldnâ€™t drive anywhere.  My arm was still hanging out of the window with a gun in my hand.  One of the guards walked up and took the gun out of my hand.
â€œWeâ€™ve called the police,â€ he said. â€œThey should be here any minute.â€  Then he walked away and waited about fifteen feet from our cars.
â€œIâ€™m screwed,â€ Code said with a terrified look on his face.  Code was in the Air Force and wasnâ€™t supposed to be so far from his base, let alone speeding around shooting paintballs at other cars at high speeds.  
When the police arrived the first officer took the gun from the security guard and walked over to me and handed it right back to me.  He took our IDâ€™s and the IDâ€™s of everyone in the car.  Then he walked over to one of seven cruisers that had surrounded us.  
About twenty minutes later he walked back to my car and gave our IDâ€™s back.  â€œYouâ€™re lucky your buddy is in the Air Force, cause I donâ€™t really feel like doing the paperwork involved in arresting him.  I donâ€™t think the chief is going be too happy when he finds out what you are doing while youâ€™re out with his daughter. â€œ  He looked over at my girlfriend and handed her ID back.  â€œHi Trish,â€ he said.  She smiled and waved at him as she smiled sheepishly.  
We got off scott free that night.  Its just too bad it wasnâ€™t so easy the next time I visited her house.
