<p>Back again. Nine days since my last update. Seems to me that I actually have like seven people that read my site. Amazing really. I really enjoyed Mark's attempt to excuse me for no updates. Although my real life for the days prior really just consisted of coffee at Wawa, studying for my accounting final, getting ready for St.Thomas and <a href="http://www.nick.com/games/nick_games/spongebob/sb_collapse.jhtml">Spongebob Collapse</a>. I am also agonizing over a few ideas that I have for a new design for the site. I know I redesign like once every four months and I know I probably said that the next redesign wouldn't be for a while but I have ideas and besides that the orange is making me want to kill. Regardless, I am offended by the anonymous comment about Bush telling the truth more frequently than I update. The last time Bush told the truth was like three months ago. </p>
<p>St. Thomas was fucking awesome. I have about 2,000 things to write about St.Thomas and non-St. Thomas related matters so check back a bunch in the next few days. In addition I will be setting up some galleries once I get my pictures developed and scan them. Check back.</p>
