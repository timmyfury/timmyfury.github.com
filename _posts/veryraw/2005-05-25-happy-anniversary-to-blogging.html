    content: Two years of blogging. timmyfury.com was registered in early 2001 and I started making animations in late 2001.  That was pre-blog timmyfury though.

<p>Tonight I finished putting what archives I still had from timmyfury.com on this site.  If you look at the history page of the site, you will notice that the very first entry was on May 26, 2003.  That makes today my two year anniversary.  I have been blogging for two years.  Timmyfury was around for longer than that, but the entry which I have named as the official start of my blogging days was the first one ever stored in a database and the first entry that ever offered comments.  Way back when I was first starting to learn how to program.  So go back and read some of the archives, particularly the archives in the timmyfury category.  They are recently added from the old blog, for nostalgia sake.  It's interesting to see how my writing style has changed (and improved i think) and how the topics I wrote about changed and how frequently I write changed.</p>
<p>For those of you who have been reading since back in the days of bad animation thanks for sticking around and humoring me for this long.  For those of you who I have never met, thanks for reading, you make my ego bigger everytime I see a comment or referer I've never seen before.</p>
