<p>There has been alot of hype about blogs in the news over the last year or so.  There has been some very much deserved  credibility given to blogs in the news and on TV.  Some very "famous" bloggers are making some very good money and receiving notoriety for their opinions and their work.  Problem is that with the fame and fortune of some many others have tried to jump on the wagon.  The effect is that since applications such as Blogger and livejournal have made it so easy to voice your opinion, every seems to think that now their opinion matters.  We all know that this is not true.  Every opinion does not matter.  I'm not saying that opinions which differ from mine are worthless.  This is not a commentary in the guise of telling you how enormous my ego is.  I'm saying that opinions which have no backing arguments or opinions which are not thought out are worthless.  People who cannot back up what they say, people who don't know what they are talking about, people who give up on their opinion when you offer just a few measley reasons why they are wrong and don't try to defend their stance should stop having opinions.  People who cannot accept their opinions being criticized should not display them in a public forum.  (Steps off soap box and continues with entry)</p>
<p>My point is that although every person <em>can</em> have a place to display their thoughts and opinions into the public forum, not every example of this is the same.  I feel that the label "blog" is too freely placed on every single person's online presence regardless of what content is contained there.  There is a classification that I feel should be established so when I hear someone talk about their online presence, I know exactly what the nature of their presence is.</p>

<p>I will now attempt to introduce a new term.  A new classification for  
<dl>
<dt>POP</dt>
<dd>Personal Online Publication</dd>
