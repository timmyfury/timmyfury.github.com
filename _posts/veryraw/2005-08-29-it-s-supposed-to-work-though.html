      While the thing certainly is ugly, I have lucked out and not run into any of these errors about 5 hours later. I still don't think I am going to use this as a replacement for the current Tuportal site. 
      So which campus are you on?

      I don't think its intended to be a replacement for the current one yet.  I think its more for testing.  They probably wanted to bring some hype.  With recent beta releases across the web, they are probably trying to tap into the trend.  The biggest difference though is that if you are a Temple student you don't have a choice but use the portal.  Gmail and gmaps and flickr and technorati need to convince you to use their service.  But again.  Each of those services worked by the time they released.  This is certainly not a Beta version.
      
      <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/BetaTest.html" rel="nofollow">If you follow these Beta testing suggestions</a> you might actually get somewhere.  I, as a beta tester, can't even get to the point where I could provide proper feedback because nearly every single feature shit out the same bloody error. 
      
      I'll try it again tomorrow.  I doubt it will have been improved by then though.  If it wasn't working when they sent the email, why would it be working now.  It's just bad planning and execution if you ask me.  Your beta test should be ready to go.  Your programmers should be at the bar celebrating and fueling for debugging as feedback comes in.  They shouldn't be finishing up their work as the email to start testing goes out.

    content: University of Texas had a portal that barely ever worked.  They claimed it only worked in Netscape for a while... then said IE.  Finally they admitted the software was just full of bugs that would be fixed "next semester" for about three semesters in a row until I stopped going to school there.  I was charged $300 a semester in fees for "using" the service.

<p>I started school again this morning.  This basically means that regular posting will start again because I am going to be thrust back into thinking mode.  I don't mind though.  As fun as the summer has been I have been stagnating and school always gets the ideas flowing.  Regardless, I received an email from Temple this evening that was pimping the beta version of the newest version of the student portal.  There are so many errors it makes my heart sad.  Here's the one that shows up all over the place.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>There are more once you log into the portal but for fear the error messages will give something away about my account.  I know that Beta webware is all the rage right now but when companies like google or yahoo release beta webware it works.  It may not be full featured, but it works.  You can't send an email to every student on the first day of class and tell them to check out something cool, then provide them with something broken.</p>
<p>Beside being total bad form, from a strictly development and security standpoint, the information that can be drawn from this kind of message can be used to bring a site to its knees.</p>
<p>On the up side, I did find this page on temple's site that has <a href="http://mdev.temple.edu/webcams/bartoncam/">live webcams</a>.  The gears are turning on that one.</p>
