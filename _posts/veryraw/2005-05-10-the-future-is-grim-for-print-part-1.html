<p>I had this conversation with an Inquirer salesman at work today. I don't think he saw this coming.  I really shot every point he made down immediately.  No hesitation in my voice.  No pausing.  It was a straight up back and forth between a smooth talking salesman and a cocky nerd.</p>
<blockquote class="conversation">
<p class="them">Inquirer guy: Hey sir, I'm from the Inquirer and I wanted to talk to you about getting the paper delivered to your house.</p>
<p class="me">Me: That's very nice of you sir, but this is a college.</p>
<p class="them">Inquirer guy: Oh well perhaps your college would like to have the paper delivered.</p>
<p class="me">Me: Well we already do in the library.</p>
<p class="them">Inquirer guy: What about your department?</p>
<p class="me">Me: Don't think we need it.</p>
<p class="them">Inquirer guy: What about in your breakroom? Bet you don't have one in there.</p>
<p class="me">Me: Don't have a break room.</p>
<p class="them">Inquirer guy: Well how about at home? When you want the newspaper you have to go out to the store to buy one. Wouldn't it be nice to have one on your doorstep every morning when you wake up?</p>
<p class="me">Me: I don't read the newspaper.</p>
<p class="them">Inquirer guy: How do you get your news?</p>
<p class="me">Me: Online.</p>
<p class="them">Inquirer guy: Oh but sir that's time consuming. You have to search all over for your news and you have to sit there for so long. The newspaper collects all of that information in one place and you can take it with you.</p>
<p class="me">Me: Well, I really hate the ink and besides google news collects all of the highlights for me and I use RSS to collect everything that google news doesn't.</p>
<p class="them">Inquirer guy: RSS?</p>
<p class="me">Me: Real Simple Syndication. It's very conveniant. Besides I'm a web developer. I sit in front of a computer all day. Nothing could be more conveniant than online news.</p>
<p class="them">Inquirer guy: I see. Well what about sports news?</p>
<p class="me">Me: Online.</p>
<p class="them">Inquirer guy: Entertainment?</p>
<p class="me">Me: Online.</p>
<p class="them">Inquirer guy: I've got you on this one. TV Guide.</p>
<p class="me">Me: Don't watch TV.</p>
<p class="them">Inquirer guy: You don't watch TV?</p>
<p class="me">Me: Rots the brain.</p>
<p class="them">Inquirer guy: I give up. Thanks for your time. *click*</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Normally I would have hung up on the guy from the start but I thought I would indulge him.  I have some thoughts on this conversation that I will cover in part two.</p>
