    content: "I think the best branding campaigns ever are probably Harley Davidson and the US Marines.  Yea, a lot of people laud Coke and Nike and the like... but how many people do you know with Coke tattooed on their bodies?\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Intensive marketing efforts are hit and miss, however, when it comes to actually generating sales.  I guess the question is whether a commercial is good because it's simply entertaining or if it only needs to increase mind share or if it actually needs to generate sales?  I mean, you want an H3 after seeing the commercial\xC3\xA2\xE2\x82\xAC\xC2\xA6 but did it make you want one bad enough to spend $29500 (the base sicker price?)  \r\n\
      \r\n\
      And if it didn\xC3\xA2\xE2\x82\xAC\xE2\x84\xA2t, the question is whether that kind of ad campaign will convince people who have 30 grand to blow on a vehicle to buy one.  \r\n\
      \r\n\
      If nothing else that the retro feel matches up with the retro gas mileage the vehicle gets (17 miles to the gallon) and retro gas emissions (10.9 tons/year) that won\xC3\xA2\xE2\x82\xAC\xE2\x84\xA2t pass in some states for much longer if legislation goes the way everyone thinks it will.  \r\n\
      \r\n\
      Detroit needs to start answering questions about why foreign automakers are able to open factories in the US, build cars here, sell them here dirt cheap and stay profitable.  \xC3\xA2\xE2\x82\xAC\xC2\xA6 and a large part of that is realizing that their marketing campaigns need to be supported by a marketable product.\r\n"

<p>The insinuation in this advertisement that <a href="http://www.hummer.com/monsters/">the H3 is the offspring of a monster and a robot</a> makes me want one.  But the marketing campaign as a whole is really well done.  <a href="http://www.jenniferlovestherobot.com/">Jennifer the monster</a> (beware sound) has a website.  On the website you can download her music from her DJ sessions.  I love the mid 90's styling of the site.  The fake animated gifs and the awesome repeating background. Robot has a website too.  <a href="http://www.robotasticinc.com/">ROBOTastic Enterprises, Inc.</a> is equally well designed and hilarious.  All around a good advertising campaign.  If their objective was to reach computer nerds who enjoy bad internet humor, mission accomplished.</p>
<p>In other news, check out the google videos page of <a href="http://video.google.com/superbowl.html">superbowl commercials</a>.  Here are some of my favorites.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=4804033000500581013">Michelob Amber - Touch Football</a> - Reminds me of the <a href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=terry+tate">Terry Tate, the office linebacker commercials</a> from a few years ago.</li>
<li><a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-3010891853586596603">Bud Light - Hidden Bud Light</a> - You can never go wrong with office violence.</li>
<li><a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1731400614466797113">Dove - Campaign for Real Beauty</a> - Okay call me softee but I thought this commercial was really touching. What an incredibly noble effort by Dove.  Maybe we will have less self-conscience freaks running around. (senstitive, not too sensitive)</li>
<li><a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5452115200083839699">Vault - Scarecrow</a> laser shooting robots?  Need I say more?</li>
<li><a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-4186888463242782209">Burger King - Whopperettes</a> - Girls dressed as food, piling on top of each other to create a delicious sandwich.  Plus the king. Little bit disturbing.  Lotta bit fun.</li>
