<p>Mark calls it meatspace.  I think its funny.  That's where I've been, meatspace.  My updates have not only been sporatic but a little non-sequitor over the last week or so.  For that I apologize (I think there are readers out there), but thats the story of life.  It's summer and it's beautiful.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago <a href="http://veryraw.com/history/2005/06/apartment-hunt-advice/">I mentioned that Trish and I were searching for an apartment</a>.  Well we've found one.  In preperation for the big move I have been preoccupied and have thought little about the blog.  Michael is on vacation renovating his new house.  So I am holding down the fort on my own.  Not that it takes much work to do. Furthermore, I am in process of working on a few projects which I am very excited about.  More on those later though.  I don't want to talk about them before I have made any significant progress.</p>
<p>So the moral of my story is that meatspace is calling me.  I'm enjoying my bike, my friends, my woman and my work.  I've got alot going on right now and you'll all have to be patient over the next few weeks until life settles down to a nice slow pace again.</p>
<p>For those who are interested in this sort of information, my brother's child collection has increased by one.  My new nephew was born at 23:00 last night.  Xavier Michael Crowe.  Healthy and with any luck a strong resemblance of his mother and not his father.  More info and a picture when it comes.</p>
