<p>I'm stting here reading &quot;Stiff&quot; by Mary Roach. An excellent book I must say. It reads like a dream and it makes me laugh and yearn to read on. The point is though that I am enjoying reading it. </p>
<p>I haven't really been enjoying my blog. It's disjointed and I've out grown my current design. Furthermore I haven't created a single design of which I like. I am uninspired. There are some features I want to add. There are some books that I want to read. There are some classes I want to pass. There's some life I would like to enjoy. None of which I am currently doing. This isn't because of the blog. There are several factors. But the blog is back there somewhere. </p>
<p>So I am going to stop blogging for a little while. Maybe a week. Maybe a month. Shouldn't be too much longer than that. I'll let you know when I have a better Idea for myself. Thanks for reading. I hope I don't lose you between now and then. </p>
<p>If you want to contact me, you should email me. See you shortly.</p>
