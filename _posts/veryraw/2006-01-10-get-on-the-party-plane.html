      I even remeber that screenshot. That picture is a monster hiding in a jpg.
      
      Take note of the time in that shot, then download and listen to the song.
      
      You will know the horror of true rage, and yearn to return all things to the abyss there after.

    content: I couldn't possibly count how many times you bastards have gotten me with that rectal wonder. The most recent and best time I've gotten goatse'd was at work. Art Mercurio asked me to get a soda out of the refridgerator. Upon opening the door I realized that instead of a refreshing beverage there was only a large picture from goatse pasted to the bottom. Goddamnit.

<p>Back in the days of the dial-up, I downloaded a song by DJ Alligator Project called "Party Plane".  I sent it to <a href="http://iam.thecolossus.net">Mark</a>, the co-creator of the bunny film.  It took him about 2 hours to download. When he listened to it he called me, said "fuck you", hung up and didn't speak to me for three days.  I've posted it on my site.  You can go <a href="http://veryraw.com/files/the_party_plane.mp3">download it</a> too. It's the worst song ever. You'll understand why it would be so infuriating to wait 2 hours to here this monstrosity.  Over the years since (this was back before napster when I used mIRC to download music) there have been many things of equivelant attacks.</p>
<p>If you have known <a href="http://iam.thecolossus.net">Mark</a> or myself for any amount of time, you have been "Party Planed".  In recent years party plane has turned into being goatse'd.  Everyone I know has been goatse'd in every way possible.  We hide them in browser bugs, redirect each other's websites, hide them in downloads; you name it.  Mark and I have done it.</p>
<p>I can't remember all the ways I have goatse'd someone.  I saw on <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/01/10/flickr_set_of_people.html">boing boing</a> that there is a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/firstgoatse/">flickr group for pictures of people seeing goatse for the first time</a>.  I need to join the group and start hitting people with the goat.  So if you have been goatse'd by either myself or <a href="http://iam.thecolossus.net">Mark</a>, comment below.  Tell me about your goatse horror stories.  </p>
