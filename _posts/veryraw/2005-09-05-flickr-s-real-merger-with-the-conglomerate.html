<p>I was trolling the flickr forums today in a <a href="http://flickr.com/groups/flick_off/">particular group</a>.  The group is set up to protest what I saw as the imminent merging of accounts for flickr with accounts for yahoo.  Come on people.  Like you didn't see this coming.  If they had waited like three more weeks someone cool like kottke would have suggested it and then everyone would have jumped on the bandwagon and then it would have been acceptable.  But since it came from the corporation and not the community first its evil.</p>
<p>In all seriousness though, I yearn for a service that can connect to every single piece of webware that I use so I don't have to use multiple passwords.  Obviously, I'm not sure how much I would trust a company with all of my access to all of my accounts everywhere, but the concept is a dream.</p>
<p>I don't know if everyone on flickr missed the memo, but hating corporations for being corporations stopped being cool like five years ago.  Once the dotcom implosion occured everyone should have realized that businesses do things for a reason, to stay alive.  They aren't out to fuck you and take your life away from you, they are basing their decisions on what will help them to build the largest customer base in the long run.  To be honest with you, the closed minded, corporation hatin', indie crowd is only good for one thing.  They make things seem cool enough that the mainstream wants to be involved.</p>
<p>In the end though, flickr is merely a service and at some point you will ditch said service for something else or for nothing at all.  You'll just find that spending hours on the internet is lame and go do something real.  It's not that big of a deal.</p>
