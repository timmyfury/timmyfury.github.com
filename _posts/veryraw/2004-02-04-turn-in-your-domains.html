<p>After recently releasing <a href="http://www.weirdhead.org/">Weirdhead.org</a>,  I was browsing this page for a, well actually I don't remember what the hell   I was looking at. What I was looking at was a mute point. I was looking at this   page and I am fascinated by the concept of a guest book. Of course calling it   this is so old school that it makes me sick. A guestbook brings instant picture of JavaScript banners and rollovers and waving email links. Regardless, on this   page the guy touts being an artist. In his guest book he has all these equally terrible artists who have left him messages about how great he is and how much they like him, the usual cock sucking misogyny. They also all leave links to their pages. So I follow them. The point to my story is this. If you are going   to make a website, make a fucking website. Don't make a homepage. No one cares   about you or your favorite links. Furthermore, If you claim to be an artist   your page better not have some fucking bullshit lame ass design that wouldn't even appeal to an orangutan surfing the fucking web in 1993. Last, if you are   one of those Neanderthals that still think that <a href="http://triangulardmensions.net/3D.html">pop-up   windows</a>, <a href="http://www.pjbuchanan.com/">roll-overs</a>, animated gifs, <a href="http://jpgrdnr.netfirms.com/">counters (not work appropriate)</a>,   <a href="http://www.stephenkasner.com/">splash pages</a> and <a href="http://www.portpak.com/daten/seite01.html">frames</a> are acceptable, it's time to turn in your domain. By the way, <a href="http://triangulardmensions.net/3D.html">disabling the right click</a> should be punishable by castration. Call me a snob, go ahead,   my page will <a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.timmyfury.com">pass validation</a>.</p>
<p>Do you think that Janet flashed her boobs to take the spotlight off of her   brother for a bit. I don't know but I have heard a lot about Janet and very   little about Michael. Just a though.</p><p>So there was a message in my last update about the WAWA500. Let me fill you all in. The WAWA500 is a brainchild of Mark's and mine. The idea is to go to   every Wawa in the fives states that there are <a href="http://www.wawa.com/">Wawa</a>'s in one 72 hours period. Then we rate them and get pictures. I have sent a message to Red Roof to get a list of all the locations of Wawa. From there we will examine   the plausibility of going to every Wawa in three days. The plan may change slightly   but the idea remains the same. I believe that we will try to schedule it for   some time when Code comes home from Qatar and Geoff is in the area. This way   everyone may participate. I'll update you as plans come together.</p>
<p> The current obsession with dieting in the life of everyone around me is sort   of scary. Christ I'm fucking fat and I still get kissed. <a href="http://www.theonion.com/4004/infograph.html">The   Onion will show us how ridiculous it is!</a></p>

<p>Jay-Z has the greatest lyric in one of his new songs. I think it's new. He's   all, "If you got girl problems I feel bad for you son, I got 99 problems   but the bitch ain't none." </p><p>Last on the agenda this week is corporate babble. A while back I ran into the add-on to Microsoft Office called <a href="http://www.dc.com/insights/bullfighter/index.asp">Bullfighter</a>. It basically reads your document and finds the bullshit corporate words. This   update had an 8.8 on a scale of 1-10 (ten being good). I don't know how accurate that is though cause we all know everything I say is bullshit. For those of   you who don't know what I'm talking about I'll explain. At work I don't fix computers, I maintain systems. I don't walk across the school to talk to Eric;   I attend an important meeting on a special project. Committee. Policy. Procedure.   We don't move computers around. We cascade them. Well anyway If you don't get it get an office job. Regardless, I read a story that I ran into on <a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a>   that some wiseass had used corporate speak to fuck with people. And I finally   got to use his line at work in our all-staff meeting. Someone asked, "What   should we do with the two computers by the door?" I reply, "Redeployment through strategic <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=defenestration">defenestration</a>."   This led me to come up with another good way of moving computers around. "In the next fiscal quarter we will institute a strategic cascading policy where   personnel will acquisition redeployed computing hardware through strategic celiac deposition" Basically we are will be giving everyone new computer's then   ramming them up their ass.</p>
