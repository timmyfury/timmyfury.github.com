      So yesterday, I take my care to the free NJ state inspection station.  I FAILED this time for a winshield wiper blade that was worn.  I am soooo pissed off.  Who the hell fails inspection for a wiper blade?    "

      Last year I took my crappy 16-year-old Olds 98 (that I bought for $500) for inspection, promptly failed. I spent over $1000 to get it into decent shape just to have the alternator break less than a month later.
      
      Every time I've taken my car for inspection, I've failed for bad wipers.

<p>Just got the word that my car is ready for me to pick up.  That's great.  Had it inspected today and had to replace the entire rear brake setup.  $600 inspection.  Plus the $250 for the new tires and alignment this weekend.  Could end up being $200 more if I can't get the two tickets I got for expired inspection thrown out.  It seems like every year I get nailed on my inspection.  Last year, right after buying the car I threw down nearly $1200 for inspection.  The year before it was $1400 for the big blue ford I was driving then.</p>
<p>Something tells me that my affinity for the $400 car is going to grow old someday.  At which point I will need to either buy a new car (a whole new can of misery for sure) or move into the city and do away with my car altogether.  Who knows.  For now I will just deal.  All in all the car has cost me only $2500 total.  Not too bad.</p>
