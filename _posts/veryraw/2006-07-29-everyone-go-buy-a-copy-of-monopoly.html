Mark sent me this article the other day about <a href="http://www.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,70131-1228653,00.html?f=rss">Parker replacing the money in Monopoly with debit cards</a>.  Thats unfortunate.  I think this is the worst idea ever.  The money is the game.  Never again will someone say, "Imagine if all this money were real!"  I'm going to go out and buy Monopoly with money.
