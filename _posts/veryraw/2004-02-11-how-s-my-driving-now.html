<p>I was reading <a href="http://www.slashdot.org/">slashdot</a> the other day. And I ran over this article about <a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2004/02/08/agenda_detection.html">meetings</a> on this guy's blog. But I found this entry too on <a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2003/07/10/nadd.html">N.A.D.D.</a> before you read this I would like to give you my rundown. Winamp full of Dead Can Dance, Dreamweaver where I am writing this update, my music library, three   instant messenger conversations, the websites to two of my online classes, my email, and as if it weren't enough I also have a two perl manuals open on my   bed and I have my psyche book in my lap from which I am taking a break to write   this. Completely separate from this topic except for the fact that it has to do with slashdot, I hate when people talk about slashdot but they don't type it out they just type " /.". It's fucking queer, stop doing that.</p>
<p>I was sitting at work on Monday and one of my co-workers walks past and asks how I am and I answer what I am supposed to answer, like a good little drone   I tell her I am doing fine. Then I realixze that its Julie and I can tell her how I really am. I mean come on its monday freaking morning. How am I supposed   to be when I have only had 4 cups of coffee. Regardless, I said, "Actually, I am horribly fine." She likes the the connotation of this and responded, "Well I am excrutiatingly okay with that." We went back and forth   for a few moments and came up with a bunch of these. Julie defined them as The   Hyperbole followed by The Mediocre. Give em the grandeur, then give em the expected.</p>
<p>I worked Camp-in again this weekend. It was rather fun. I'm really into it   this year. I wish I could work more of them. Perhaps a death plot for one of   the other three managers. Hmmmm. um... okay... well it was an interesting evening. It was the night of the <a href="http://www.philly.com/mld/dailynews/news/local/7927690.htm">   incident at the library</a>. This wasn't an issue for us although I was worried   early in the night that it may get passed to one of the parents and we would have a bunch of histerical mothers on our hands. There were 600, yes 600, girls   and mothers in the museum on Saturday night. The only 7 guys there were staff.   Damn. Here's the poin though. The craziest part of the night was when I was woken up at 4:20 in the morning and the security guard tells me that there is   an alarm clock going off in the store right next to an exhibit that has 77 girls   sleeping in it. It took me a good five minutes to figure out what the hell he   was talking about. I went down to the exhibit and knew right away I was going   to have to call like everyone in the museum at home at 4:30am. This alarm clock   was playing some whack ass disco music and singing and shit. It was crazy. I   ran around the museum for about 30 minutes finding phone numbers and calling   people to try to find a key to the store. No one had one and all the while more and more girls were stirring and my boss was doing all this crazy talk about   moving 77 girls to another place to sleep at 4:30 in the morning. At about 4:45am,   the alarm had been doing its middle-eastern love cry for about 45 minutes now, it just turned off. And thank god cause I do believe that I had about 10 more   minutes before I was forced to walk the plank on the ship in Kid Science.</p>
<p>Idea of the year... I think it is. You know those stickers on bussiness cars   that say, "How's my driving? Call 1-800-PHONE-NUMBER ID-OF-DRIVER"   okay so I think that I want to get one of those made up but put my cell phone number on it. Then I'll go out driving like a complete retard. Someone will   naturally call to report it and I'll be like "What are you a fucking five year old. You fucking taddle-tail!" then hang up. Or even better I could   be like, "Describe what he's doing." Then start driving back and forth   across the road. Drive into oncoming traffic. Wow. That would be great.</p>
