<p>I have pretty much listened to nothing but <a href="http://www.dirty.org/underworld/">Underworld</a> for about three weeks. I really don't think I will ever get bored of them. For those of you who have never heard of them, they are close to my favorite band. They make the most amazing, emotion inspiring music you have ever heard. (Just short of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00005BJ2O/002-9615771-0650406"> Moulin rouge soundtrack</a>, eh Mark?) Don, Jenny, Trish and I went to see them in New York City almost two years ago and it was the most amazing show. It was even better than <a href="http://www.u2.com/lite/">U2's Popmart tour</a>. The fucking show just built and built for nearly two hours until they played <em>Born Slippy</em> and the whoop drops and its all <em>dent,dent,dent,dent... dent,dent,dent,dent... boh,boh...</em> Gives me chills just thinking about it. I danced my arse off that night and still get mocked occasionally for looking like a doof when I dance. Here was the playlist for the night.</p>
<ol>
<li>Skyscraper</li>
<li>Cowgirl / Rez</li>
<li>Two Months Off</li>
<li>Dinosaur Adventure 3d</li>
<li>Twist</li>
<li>Dirty Epic</li>
<li>Mo Move</li>
<li>Dark Train</li>
<li>Improvisation</li>
<li>Jumbo</li>
<li>Born Slippy NUXX</li>
<li>Push Upstairs</li>
<li>Pearl's Girl</li>
<li>Moaner</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have not had the pleasure of hearing Underworld perhaps you will instant message me (MyMouthIsAToilet or TimmyFury on AIM) and I will share with you.</p>

<p>The last thing they release was <em><a href="http://www.dmcworld.com/backtomine/underworld.asp">Back to mine</a></em>, a remix album. There is perhaps will be some new material on a <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story?id=5936100">DJ Sasha compilation</a>.  I am dying to have some new Underworld to listen to.  I would love to go see them again too. Check them out.  They are freaking good.</p>
<p>The pictures of the concert itself are not mine. The only reason I have them is because they were so good and I wanted them for memories sake. I put them here at risk of retribution from the blogging gods. I couldn't help myself though. Go see the <a href="http://sullen.org/gallery/underworld">entire gallery</a>. I think that the site is run by a girl named <a href="http://sullen.org/">Aimee at Sullen.org</a>. These pictures can also be viewed on the <a href="http://www.dirty.org/underworld/reviews/2002_newyork.htm">review of the concert at Hammerstein Ballroom</a>.</p>
