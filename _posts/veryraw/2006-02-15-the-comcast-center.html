    content: I had the chance to see the <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn6781" rel="nofollow">next tallest building</a> in the world going up in Dubai.  What was amazing wasn't the building itself, it was the 25 or so other sky scrapers they are building around it.

I walk by this place on my way to work.  It's gonna be monstrous.  The new tallest building in Philadelphia. I'm loving the integration with Septa.  Revitalize public transport for Philadelphia.  Well, at least a little bit. I've never gotten to watch a building of this size go up.  It's pretty interesting.

You can also check out the <a href="http://forum.skyscraperpage.com/showthread.php?t=65276">renders of the finished building</a> which look amazing.
