<p>I have previously created a few VR applications in both <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/">Quicktime</a> and in <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/flash/">Flash</a>. I think they are cool but I have never had a real application for them. No reason to really do them for real (really). I did one of the <a href="http://www.fi.edu/tfi/info/fels.html">Fels Planeterium at the Franklin Institute</a> and one of the outside of hall in front of <a href="http://www.dccc.edu/library/">the library and my office at DCCC</a>. You can <a href="http://www.timmyfury.com/things/vr/">take a look at both of them</a> on the same page.</p>
<p>Regardless of this fact I read a blog by <a href="http://www.1976design.com/blog/">a guy named Dunstan</a> in England. I am fond of his photography and his design. But I stole this idea from an entry he did a few weeks back. <a href="http://www.1976design.com/blog/archive/2004/04/01/home-photos/">He made a panorama of his bedroom</a>. I have done the same with <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/timmyfury/15404822/">my room</a>.</p>

<p>Take special notice of these things.  They are my favorite things in the room</p>
<ul>
<li>computer with two monitors</li>
<li>bull skull</li>
<li>the abomidable snowman</li>
<li>collection of simpsons toys</li>
<li>gas mask</li>
<li>cowboy hats</li>
<li>clay sphinx</li>
<li>British Airways rug</li>

<li>The map with pins to mark places I've been</li>
</ul>
