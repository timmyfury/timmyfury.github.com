Over the last few years I have become increasingly disturbed by what I see the future of the country and our people becoming for the duration of my time here.  I would like to avoid pointing out particular political points of view which have led me to this realization.  I think that if you are of the same general philisophical persuasion as I, you will read this and think of several things that the leaders of our country (and the world at large) have done or said over the  last few years that makes your skin crawl.  Instead I'll focus simply on societal opinions which seem to be emerging that make me sad to be... intelligent.

In the eighties there was the <em>War on Drugs</em>.  Now we have the <em>War on Terrorism</em>.  More importantly though it seems that America is fighting a war on intelligence right now.  Decency and thinking are falling out of style with the masses and people are becoming increasingly sendentary about challenging the ideas that those in power push our way.  In a sweeping gradious way, Americans seem to be accepting them as truth without checking qualifications.  Our leaders need no other training than the ability to smile sheepishly after saying something stupid and a couple of years of bible study.
