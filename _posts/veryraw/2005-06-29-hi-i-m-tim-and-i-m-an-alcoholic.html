<p>Stop saying that.  The only time that its acceptable to say that is at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.  And you had better be a freaking alcoholic. If you say that anywhere else when you introduce yourself you should be thrown out.  You're just trying to be funny.  You're not.</p>
<p><em>Okay upon talking to Mark I decided to put a break in here.  The rest of the entry is complete nonsense and may not make as much sense (or humor) to you as it did to me. Read beyond this point at your own risk.</em></p>

<p>I wish my name was Timothy Jack Daniels Crowe. Like... I wish thats what my parents had named me.  It would be great cause then people would think that I was trying to be funny like in the aforementioned example.  But that would actually be my name.  It would be awesome when I went to job interviews and shit and they thought I was just being a complete jerkoff.</p>
<p>Problem is though that I can't change my name to that because it wouldn't be natural.  Then I would actually be doing it just for the humor. </p>
<p>It would be even better if my parents had raised me in the mormon or amish tradition.  Then people would be able to grin at the irony of the name of such a chaste and prudent man.</p>
