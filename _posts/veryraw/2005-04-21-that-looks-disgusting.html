    content: I haven't been there in a few weeks, but I know the feeling. MMMMM Humus!!! I'm also addicted to their fries and their lemonade.. and the funny this about that is that I'm allergic to lemonade and it fills my mouth with ulcers afterwards. But i don't care damnit.

<p>Ever had falafel?  Me either, until a few weeks ago.  Mark, Geoff, Dan and I met Burn at <a href="http://www.maoz.nl/about.html">Moaz Vegetarian</a> on South Street.  It's amazing.  I can't get enough.  I've been there like 3 times in three weeks and I'm seriously addicted.  I nearly died the night I went on a bike ride with Dan one night.  I ate two falafels that night.  Then I tried to ride back to the car.   It was seriously like 30 blocks and I thought I would die for sure.  The whole way they were fighting and kicking like I had just eaten a jar of agave worms.</p>
<p>I've heard that there's no place like Maoz though for falafel.  If you haven't had one before you dont know what you're missing.  Check out these falafel pictures, they make it look fucking discusting.</p>
