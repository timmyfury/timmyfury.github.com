<p>This weekend we took a trip to Fayetteville, NC to visit Code and Crissy.  Nearly 1000 miles of driving and a court summons in Virginia later, we return with more fireworks then any three idiots should ever have in their possesion.  There are pictures abound. <del>Trish and Michelle still have to upload and name theirs and when they do I'll add a link to them so y'all can check 'em out.</del>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/timmyfury/sets/400721/">Here are mine</a>. <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/sunflowerseed/sets/404497/">Here are Trish's</a> and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/bratacious/sets/413626/">here are Michelle's</a>.</p>
