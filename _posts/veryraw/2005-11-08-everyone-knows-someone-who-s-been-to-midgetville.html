      The Terror of Tiny Town (1938)
      
      An all midget cast that takes place in an all midget town. I think the midgetville legend may have something to do with this.

      I have been to what come people called midgetville in Del Co.  Ridley Park (off of rt 13).  All of the houses were one story.  I didn't see any midgets, nor was there any rock throwing.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Now, the one place that was cool was the \xC3\xA2\xE2\x82\xAC\xCB\x9Csatan\xC3\xA2\xE2\x82\xAC\xE2\x84\xA2 house in Ches Co.  It wasn't far from where that movie was made.  The story goes that since there is so much evil going on in there, that the trees grow away from the road \xC3\xA2\xE2\x82\xAC\xE2\x80\x9C which is true.  It also says that you get followed if you go on that road.  I was there twice.  Each time I was followed very close (it\xC3\xA2\xE2\x82\xAC\xE2\x84\xA2s a very small back road along the Brandywine) and then suddenly the car disappeared)  I saw the Devils Tree too.  It really does look like a skull.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      I found out that over this past summer, they closed the road.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Here is a link that has more info.\r\n\

      And I've been to the satanic church/house on the DE/PA border.  *Many times*  That area of DE is full of creepy stuff.  I refer you to a post Tim had several years back w/ pix of twisted railroad tracks and a boxcar in the water.  But in general it's a lot of twisty backroads where there are always nutty teen DE drivers, all lit up and trying to get air on the hills.  Also, a lot of the road painting down there -- it's for local high schools (I'm referring to the non-'satanic' road painting of course).  "

      if you are in front of taylor hospital, midgetville is directly across the street. there's a steep driveway that's marked private property that brings you right into it, though i've never seen a midget there. satanic church might actually be a group of luciferians meeting place...seriously. the one thing that scares you in that area of beaver valley is ---------mill road, where all the trees bend sharply away from the house. 
       as for people getting beheaded on space mountain...not everyday, but space mountain is the 10th most cited ride in personal injury lawsuits from 1954-1992. the most cited is autopia, really stay away from that.
       according to mythbusters, you can blow up your stomach by ingesting enough poprocks and soda. but mikey was on the show, so i guess he didn't go out that way.

    content: "me and four of my friends just went to \"midgetville\" today (January 13 2006 wich is friday the 13th...weird). i heard something about it from my college friends a few times and awlays wanted to go, even though i never though i was real. well we got bored and went out to find it. it is directly off of 202 on beaver valley road, and then i believe it is the first right, maybe the second. we drove down the private drive and almost turned around, but my friend saw another driveway. so we went down there and i'll be damned we found it. after two hours of driving and not finding it we stumbled on to it right before we were about to go home. we were all shocked but then we realized what we saw and we could not stop laughing. It is a real place. everything is small. the speed limit is 14 miles an hour! i dont know why but i swear it is. stops signs, benches, flag poles, and yes houses are so tiny. i cryed for about 5 min. because i was laughing so hard. no midgets but there were some lights on in the houses and news papers on the door steps, so i know they live there. i promise you this is a real place and if you ever need something to do, go there.

    content: i went to midgetville off of gallows road the other night. I saw the small cottages. The word is that if u drive down the gravel trails during the day that the midgets will come out of their homes and launch rocks and other forms of debris at you. I was wondering if that was true. I went there at night and all u can hear is this loud beeping noise that wont stop, until u start walking. I suppose its a motion detector. Let me know what you think. Thanks!!!

    content: I have been to Satanville off of Cossart rd in Chadsford area. It's right after a do not enter sign near a wawa. My friends and I just drove around and around and found weird creepy things. Some trees grew away from the road. One house had chickens hanging and some other Voodoo stuff. I saw 666 and KKK spray painted. Nothing too bad. As far as Midgetville, I hear it exists in Ridley PA, but i've never been there.. only my friends have.. hehe

    content: I've been to a midgitville in Riverside, Ca. but it was a few years ago. I went with a group of friends one night. It was off a dirt road, and quit odd. The tallest odject there was the water tower, which stood about 15 ft. tall. This place look real old, like before cars old. There were I think 6 or 7 houses, but most were completely destroyed, with the exception of one build into a small mountain. It had a stone arch over the walk way no more than 4 ft tall, and the house was about 5 ft. tall. I think the freakiest part ways the childrens voices we heard the entire time we were there. Keep in mind this was like midnight or later and there were little kids voices through the trees. Also in redlands, ca. there is a haunted school house. Rumor to that is that back in the day the teacher flipped out and killed the students. According to the Historical plaque posted at the site, this is true. The school is gated off now, but when you are there at night, if you walk around the back side and shine a flash light inside some weird stuff happens.

<p><a href="">5ives</a> is one of my favorite sites.  A few months ago He wrote a list called <a href="http://www.5ives.com/archives/2004/08/17/five-favorite-rumors-of-my-childhood/">Five favorite rumors of my childhood</a>. Here's the list...</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Bubble Yum is made from spiders&#8217; eggs</li>
<li>Mikey died from mixing Pop-Rocks and Coke</li>
<li>That one really weird teacher is &#8220;a gay&#8221;</li>
<li>People get beheaded on Space Mountain, literally, every day</li>
<li>One time, Rod Stewart drank a <em>gallon</em> of semen and totally had to have his stomach pumped </li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>I loved this cause I remember I had a few of these.  This guy must be a bit older than me cause for me it was Lil' Kim not Rod Stewart.  I knew a girl in elementary school who wouldn't eat butterfingers because she thought they were made with crushed glass.  Someone else I know told me that she thought when you whistle, the angels cry.  I also had a friend, Bobby used to just make things up.  Anything he wanted.  We were building a fort once behind this guys house and there was a stack of fences in his back yard.  Bobby convinced us to steal them because he knew that the guy who owned the house was deaf and blind from a fire in his house.</p>
<p>Anyway, Trish and I were talking to a friend of her's a few weeks ago and she brought up Midgetville.  For those who don't know, Midgetville is a made up town.  When I was little everyone knew someone who had been there but they had never been there themselves.  Small houses.  The midgets would always run out of their houses and throw rocks at your car.  I thought it was in Springfield.  Trish said near Taylor Hospital.  Michelle said it was near the Granite Run Mall.  The details were different for everyone.</p>
<p>Do you remember any irrational fears or bizarre misconceptions from your childhood?  Where was midgetville for you? Do they throw rocks there?</p>
