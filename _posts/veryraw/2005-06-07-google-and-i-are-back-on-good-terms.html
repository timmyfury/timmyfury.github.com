<p>Two months ago I wrote <a href="http://veryraw.com/history/2005/03/but-google/">But Google, we had such a good thing going!</a>.  I had been experimenting with 43 things the goal tracking site.  After about two weeks my ranking for google's favorite Timothy Crowe had disappear.  Veryraw was replaced with my 43 things page.  What a crock.  Not only that but my listing for veryraw had completely been removed.</p>
<p>So after realizing that 43things was less about keeping track of goals and more about keeping track of failures, I deleted my account.  One week later I had returned to the top of the google rankings for Timothy Crowe.  It just goes to show the power of a site like 43things.  The entire site is made of of interlinking pages.  When google hit it, it found a way to get to my profile on thousands of pages.  Causing 43things to reference my name an immense amount of times and take over my spot.</p>
<h3>Why does this matter</h3>
<p>As I've said before, the internet is what a good portion of my life is based on.   My income depends on it.  Someday I will go out looking for a new job and they will want to know what I've done.  It would be great to be able to google my name and have my own site come up.  It would be great to show that I have been in the presence of the internet for long enough that I own my own name.</p>
<p>It's the focus of a New York Times article<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/02/fashion/thursdaystyles/02GOOGLE.html?ei=5094&en=46d691e7971b0c87&hp=&ex=1117684800&adxnnl=1&partner=homepage&pagewanted=all&adxnnlx=1117674001-Eak8/V2%204BSLvGFbLAzCQQ&oref=login"> , Loosing Google's Lock on the Past</a> (one that features <a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/2005/06/02/defining_ones_">a hilarious image of Anil Dash wearing the goatse tshirt</a>).  In the future details of everyone will be available on the internet and as Anil said in his article, <a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/2002/12/17/privacy_through">privacy through identity control</a>, the best way to ensure that the correct information about you is on the internet is to put it there yourself.</p>
<p>I have spent alot of time over the last two year building an online persona and the day that my 43 things profile took over that spot I though that all my work had been poured down the drain.  Glad to see I'm back on top.</p>
<p><em>Slightly related and sort of interesting is that when you do a search for my name the article about google ditching veryraw comes up second to my site.  <a href="http://photos10.flickr.com/17215358_adf554fc4f_o.jpg" title="Photo Sharing">I've saved a screenshot of it for prosperity sake</a>.</em></p>
