<p>I don't get really excited about movies very frequently, but these two movie trailers made me shiver..  These two trailers gave me shivers though.  I loved the first two X-Men movies and the third one looks twice as awesome as the first two. It seems to be about unneccesary government oversight and control Doesn't come out for a few months though.  V for Vendetta comes out sooner though.  Seems to have a communist block, governmental control thing going on.  Anyway, <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Video/videos/snl_1439_natalieraps.shtml">Natalie Portman</a> is in the movie.  That's already one big tick in the awesome box. She's just building her nerd cred.</p>
