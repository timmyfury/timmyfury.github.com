<p>A little over a month ago <a href="http://veryraw.com/history/2005/03/more-on-social-bookmarks-an-application/">I wrote about how Mark finally understood the benefits to del.icio.us</a>.  I had a similar problem with RSS.  I knew it was cool to have it but I really didn't understand why.  Apparently, I'm <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/finally_getting_it.php">not the only one</a>. Over the past few months, the amount of time I devoted to reading sites on tons of different subjects has grown longer and longer.  Most of this time can be attributed to just opening all of those sites up to find that they hadn't updated.</p>
<p>I had been reading about different RSS readers, and asked Don a bunch of questions about how he uses RSS, and decided to give it a try.  I downloaded <a href="http://sage.mozdev.org/">Sage</a>, loaded up all of my sites, and added their feeds.  After using it for about a week, I finally get it.  My time reading sites has been cut in half.  Not only that but I have added more sites without an increase in time.  I only load the sites that have been updated and don't waste time anymore.  This gave me the ability to remove the list from my site and widen the column and include more flickr images. Life is good.</p>
<p>So if you notice at the top of the page I have added a <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/timmyfury">syndicate</a> link.  I am experimenting with <a href="http://feedburner.com/">feedburner</a>. It's a site that allows you to combine feeds from many sources to make one super awesome mega-feed.  If you are subscribed to my old feed, that will remain.  This new feed includes my del.icio.us links and my flickr images.  It's the total veryraw experience without hitting my site.</p>
