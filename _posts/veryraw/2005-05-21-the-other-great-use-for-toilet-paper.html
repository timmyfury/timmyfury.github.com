<p>Back in tenth grade of high school I went on a trip with my high school to Madrid, Spain and Paris, France.  It was a great trip and I still have contact with several of the people that I was on that trip with.  Many of them I see on a regular basis (whether or not it has anything to do with the trip).  Worthless reminiscing aside, there were 36 students on the trip total, 6 of which were guys.  Pretty sweet odds, although I was far too nerdy back then (back then?). When we got to the hotel in Madrid, we were given two rooms for guys.  We split up into two groups of three.  The first group went to their room.  The view was amazing.  You could see the entire city from that room.  So I went over to my room and opened our windows and only found a wall.  The wall you see in the picture next door.</p>
<p>There were four walls and a pit at the center.  In the bottom of the pit was an enormous air conditioning unit.  We were a little bit disparaged, but as they say, "when the world gives you lemons... you throw them as hard as you can at the air conditioning unit at the bottom of the pit outside of your hotel room."  Actually, we threw way more than that down there that week.  Oranges and apples and ashtrays.  Each time they would hit the unit and make a terrible bang and you would here people open the other windows up and down the pit and scream at us in various languages.</p>
<p>The most fun thing that we threw out the window was wads of toilet paper that had been soaked in water.  They hit the wall and explode, then they would peel from the wall and fall to the bottom of the gourge and strike the air conditioner.</p>
<p>There's not a man on earth that hasn't done this.  Its almost a guarentee if you ask a guy what you do with toilet paper in a junior high bathroom, he'll say soak it in water and throw it at a wall.  I mentioned toilet paper to Michael the day i told the Spain story to Trish and the first thing he asked was, "did you ever soak it in water and throw it against a wall?"  Try it, it's really fun and you'll laugh so hard you'll be glad you're already in the bathroom.</p>
<p>As for the wall in Madrid, I'd love to go back there one day and see if the air conditioner is stil dented and the toilet paper is still stuck to the wall.</p>
