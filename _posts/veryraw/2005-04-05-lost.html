<p>I manipulated this image a long time ago and I think a ton of people have seen it but I'm not positive.  Its made with about six different images.  I've included the main image that I used. It's Jarrod's little brother RJ.  Thought what I did to him was sufficiently creepy and shouldn't be kept to myself.</p>
