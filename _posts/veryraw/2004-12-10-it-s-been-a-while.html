<p><a href="http://iam.thecolossus.net/">Mark</a> informed me this morning that its been a while since I've posted.  He's right.  It has.  Partially his fault though.  I have been hella busy.  I've been working on a redesign of Mark's company's website.  In addition, like many others who read this, its finals week next week which means my brain is burning with final projects, late papers and exams.</p>
<p>I took fifteen credits this semester thinking I would have time at work to do homework.  Then I was promoted.  The new position rules (more on this later) but I have <strong>no time</strong> for homework.  So I am playing catchup. </p>
<p>Next weekend it will all be over and I can go back to a regular pace of posting.  For now though you will have to bare with me.  I have about five half written entries and another ten which are researched but not written.  I just don't have time. In addition, I have all of the old timmyfury.com content which will be going up here and all the animations.  There are photos to scan, sites to develop, stories to tell.  Be patient. Thanks for being understanding.</p>
<p>Now go enjoy <a href="http://www.jengajam.com/r/Disco-Hitler">Hitler the disco-f&#252;hrer</a>.  This one should hold you over until Wednesday.  I have a meeting with an Army Intelligence Agent. I'll tell you about it Wednesday.</p>
