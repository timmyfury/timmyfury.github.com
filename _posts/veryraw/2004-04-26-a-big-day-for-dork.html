<p>So I worked a <a href="http://www.fi.edu/tfi/programs/camp-in.html">Camp-in</a> on Friday night at the Franklin Institute.  Exhausting yet rewarding, the night went really well considering there were 600 campers were seven to twelve years old. Oh yeah and they were all girls. I have this theory that I am purposely put on for these very strenuous nights as some sort of joke. Up until now I couldn't say this because the four managers made there own schedules in January. But this Friday's campin was given to me by Amy my boss when one of the managers broke his foot in Montreal. I am of the opinion that she gave me this one on purpose. Other than this particular Camp-in I can't blame her because, well, I picked the rest. Unless this is some cosmic conspiracy in which some evil diety forced me to choose those particular Camp-ins.</p>
<p>In all seriousness these are the nights that I enjoy the most because the energy in the museum is so high that it makes the hair on your neck stand up. If you could bottle it, third world nations could run for years on a single container. Unfortunately then we would surely be forced to abide by child labor laws, and lets be honest now. Who wants to abide by child labor laws.</p>
<p>The night was boat loads of fun and had one extra added bonus. I rode a <a href="http://origin.www.segway.com/segway/specs_iseries.html">Segway</a>. For those who don't know what a Segway is here is an explaination from the <a href="http://origin.www.segway.com/">Segway HT website</a>.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://origin.www.segway.com/segway/introduction.html">
<p>Segway Human Transporter (HT) can self-balance because of a technology called dynamic stabilization. Dynamic Stabilization works in much the same way your own sense of balance does. Where you have an inner ear, eyes, muscles, and a brain to keep you balanced, the Segway HT has solid-state gyroscopes, tilt sensors, high-speed microprocessors, and powerful electric motors performing to keep it balanced. Working in concert, these extensively tested, redundant systems sense your center of gravity, instantaneously assess the information, and make minute adjustments one hundred times a second. Segway HT balances whether you're traveling at 10 mph, carrying a heavy load, slowly maneuvering in tight spaces, or standing perfectly still.</p>
<p>Move forward. Go forward.</p>
<p>The Segway HT intuitively balances the way humans do - moving forward and backward, responding to changes in your body's position. There is no accelerator and no brakes. Lean forward and you move forward. Straighten up and you stop. Lean back, and you move back. To turn, rotate the steering grip under your wrist in either direction. Operation is natural, intuitive, and one of the primary reasons Segway HT so seamlessly integrates into enterprise situations, pedestrian environments, and everyday life.</p>

<p>It was the most fun I have had since I learned how to do spin outs on my Knight Rider <a href="http://bigwheelrally.home.att.net/obw/originalbigwheel-pg.htm">big wheel</a> or donuts in my rear wheel drive eight cylinder. It is easily the greatest invention ever. It's like walking but not. Mark and I were trained on it by Kerry, all of which are in the pictures below. Thank god for training too cause I would have killed myself on that thing. Mark almost did kill himself when he was leaving the IMAX theater and smacked his head on the doorway on his way out. Thank goodness for helmets I suppose.</p>
<p>In case anyone is feeling especially charitable, I have added a Segway to my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/1SXUQEDHC006V">Amazon.com Wishlist</a>.</p>
