      Yes, no more Flash. Please. I'd like that to be heard everywhere - from band sites, to fast-food sites. I hate Flash. You can't bookmark anything, like you said, there's no way to FIND text on the page (search), and it completely slows down my entire browsing experience - waiting for silly intros to culminate, or elements to slide in properly.
      
      I don't have time for that crap.

<p>I found this band yesterday that I really like.  Gay for Johnny Depp. They are pretty good, remind me of The Blood Brothers.  So I do a search for them and I come up with there <a href="http://gayforjohnnydepp.com/">website</a>. Its freaking horrible. A goddamned nightmare. Let me tell you whats wrong with the site...</p>
<ul>
<li>The name of the band is not even on the site.  I wasn't sure if it was even the bands website.</li>
<li>Frames.  Bloody frames.  Stop fucking using frames. You're not hiding anything from me, I will get what I want from your site if I want it.  Frames will not stop me.</li>
<li>Flash music player.  Whats the point.  Offer me music to download. I don't want to listen to it on your rotten website.</li>
<li>Creative non-descript titles for your links.  They aren't creative really, I don't know what they are.  I don't know how to find the content I want.</li>
<li>The worst offense of all.  How do I buy your fucking album.  The sites I am refered to are un-navigable. I can't find your album anywhere.  Why would I ever buy an album from a store I can't find anything in.</li>
</ul>
<p>After all this I still want to buy the album but I don't know how.  I tried amazon but got no where.  Putting your music on amazon isn't selling out, its smart.  Why would you make your music so difficult to find.</p>
<p>Just for prosperity sake I should mention a few other things that bother me in addition to those mentioned above about band websites...</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stop using Flash</strong>.  I can't link to a part of your site if you are using flash.  It makes it impossible to navigate and I don't bloody care how many things you can get to fly across my screen in like three seconds.  <a href="http://handsomeboymodelingschool.com/">Handsome Boy Modeling School</a> is a classic example of the overuse of Flash. If you click that link there is a good chance your computer will come to a stand still and your browser will crash.</li>
<li><strong>Don't put a link up to content then put an under construction page there</strong>. It's so annoying.  I hate in the off occasion that I can actually find what I want on a band site the content isn't actually there. <a href="http://thebloodbrothers.com/flash.html">The Blood Brothers</a> are not only a great example of this (try downloading a song or two), but they also use worthless un-navigable flash.</li>
<li><strong>Offer me some sample music</strong>. I mean full songs.  Snippets never get stuck in my head and make me hunt your album down.</li>
<li><strong>Give me metadata</strong>. Before you upload those songs to your site, make sure the metadata is proper so I can find it again in my music player later.  If I can't find it, I can't listen to it again and again, therefore it will never get stuck in my head and force me to buy your album. I downloaded two songs from the <a href="http://www.yeahyeahyeahs.com/">Yeah Yeah Yeahs</a> website last night and they had no metadata. It took me like five minutes to find it again once I imported it into my itunes library.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is certainly not a comprehensive list.  This is merely a list of the things that irritate me most about band sites. When I go to a band site, I want to know history, lyrics, discography and I want to download media.  Give me information on your site.  Your music is your art, not your website.</p>
