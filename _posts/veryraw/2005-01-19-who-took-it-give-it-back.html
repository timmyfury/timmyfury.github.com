      The one advantage to being fat is that you have no gut, its more like a round ball. My fat is tight.

<p>Let me preface this by reminding everyone that I am a big dude.  I'm not enormously fat.  I have a gut.  As any man with a gut will attest, possesion of a gut results in a deeper belly button than the normal person.</p>

<p>That said... everyday I come home from work, sit at my desk, change my socks, untuck my shirt and pick my belly button.  Everyday when I pick my belly button there is a large ball of belly button lint there.  I remove it, admire it and discard it.</p>

<p><strong>Today there was no lint.  Who the fuck stole my belly button lint?!?!?!</strong></p>
