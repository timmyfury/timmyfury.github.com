    content: There is that outside chance that you could get a real piece of crap but I think that if you look hard enough and you don't settle for something that doesn't fit your needs then you will be okay. No place is perfect, that's why people buy houses, then they can make it perfect.  But finding some good in where you live is important to your well-being.

      That's good advice, Tim.  Here is what I would add:
      
      -Check out your neighborhoods of choice both during the day and at night.  Determine the shady factor.
      -Consider how close you want to be to things -- public trans, the Wawa :), etc.  Do you want to have to drive to everything?  Can you get anywhere if you are carless?
      -Driving around and looking for signs is good, but canvassing on foot is also good, esp. in hot neighborhoods where everyone wants in.  Owners there might not even bother with ads. 
      
      Good luck to you and Trish!

    content: Great point.  Being able to get places without driving is key.  One of our main goals in this move is to get as close to work as we can.  The less time we spend in the car everyday the better.

    content: You know its funny you say that.  I was just saying to Trish the other day that when I moved into the Fort years ago we didn't follow any of these rules. We just sort of found the first place that would rent to three 21 year old dudes.  Which I actually think may be the only rule that you have to follow if you are a 21 year old dude.  "Find the first sucker that will rent to a 21 year old dude."

<p>Trish and I (among several other friends) are searching for an apartment.  We have found a few good prospects but nothing that gives us the firm caress of confidence that we are looking for.  We want to find that perfect place.  Here's my advice for finding your dream joint.</p>
<ul>
<li>Take your time.  There are tons of properties for rent all the time.  Wait until you find the one you want.</li>
<li>Search all possible sources.  Newspapers, online directories, craigslist and realtors.  Don't discount driving around and looking for signs.  Not only will you find tons of things that aren't advertised, sometimes before anyone else has gotten a chance to look at the place, but it also helps give you an opportunity to see the neighborhood and learn the roads and stores in the immediate area.</li>
<li>Explore all of your options.  Look at as many places as you can.  You have to live there for a year.  This is a big decision and could make your life a living hell or a wonderful paradise.</li>
<li>If you call an advert for a place and it takes them four days to get back to you, this is not the place for you.  If it takes them four days to get back to you when you are trying to give them money, they will never call you back when you need them after you move in.  You have more chance of drinking every ounce of water pouring from your hot water heater than you do of the rushing over to help you.</li>
<li>Know what you want before you even look. Number of bedrooms, price range, acceptable areas, types of housing.  Make sure you know what you are don't want.  What's going to be a deal breaker and what are you willing to bend on.</li>
<li>Find out what the other tenants are like.  If this means breaking down the doors of your future neighbors, so be it.  I don't know if you can take the landlord's or heaven forbid the realtor's opinion into account but i suppose they would have a reasonable idea.</li>
</ul>
<p>Above all the most important thing is to be patient and don't lose your cool.  I am totally eager to get a place, but impatience will lead to a crappy apartment that will make me want to move back into, heaven forbid, my parent's house.</p>
