      I support the ms bike ride through a co-worker.  I remember her saying it is difficult depending on the weather.  She belongs to a bike group in philly.  
      
      Good luck preparing for it!

    content: Cross country eh? thats quite an undertaking... but i would gladly do it. Biking through the rockies would be so damn exhilerating. Although hiting the pacific and realizing you have to bike the whole way back would be a bit much. What kind of time frame are you looking at for the length of the trip? I have no idea how long something like that would take. Six weeks seems kinda conservative.

    content: "Actually, after my initial planning phase I decided not to try East-West yet.  Instead I am thinking traveling Route 1 (well, Route 1A...) from Aroosook Maine to Key West.  It is a shorter ride, I know people who can put me up for the night along the way, and friends can join me for various legs by flying out and riding home.  I'm estimating about 60 miles a day, so it should take about 35 days or so.  So far I have three people signed up as interested in taking part in at least part of the ride...\r\n\
      \r\n\
      If all goes well, East West could happen two years from now.  "

<p>There's been a bit of crazy talk on <a href="http://macweblog.blogspot.com/2005/08/im-losing-my-mind.html">Brian's blog</a>.  And it was continued in <a href="http://veryraw.com/history/2005/08/geoblogger-what-an-awesome-application-should-be/">the comments of my last entry</a>.  The idea is a cross country ride.  A tour from ocean to ocean.  <a href="http://www.biketouring.net/">John Dorsey</a> has written a really extensive account of his first trip across and the adventure that the idea offers is nearly more than I can handle.  It sounds exciting and fun.</p>
<p>There are obvious issues though.  I am currently about 50 pounds outside of the weight I would need to be to make a ride like that.  John says that the only thing that can prepare you  for six weeks of riding 75 miles a day is six weeks of riding 75 miles a day, but I must say that being in relatively proper shape from the start will make it easier.  I figure two years will be a proper amount of time to train for something like this.  Weights and eating right and all.</p>
<p>I need to do some reasearch on bikes and get a new lighter bike.  Mine currently weighs about 35 pounds.  I should probably get a lighter one if I am going to strap 100 pounds of gear to it.  I also need to get my endurance up and take some really long rides.  I would like to make the ride to King of Prussia sometime in September.  I would like to plan a few other long rides and by next June (or there abouts) I would like to make a really long, multiple day journey.  New York City to Philadelphia and later Boston to Philadelphia or Washington.  </p>
<p>There is also this <a href="https://www.nationalmssociety.org/pae/event/event_detail.asp?e=6654">City to Shore bike tour</a> that I think I could probably participate in by the end of September if I worked hard through August and the beginning of September.  Thinking about it but not sure.</p>
