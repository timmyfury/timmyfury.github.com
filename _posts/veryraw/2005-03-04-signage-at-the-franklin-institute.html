    content: I noticed more awesome signs at work last night.  As you enter the Franklin Memorial there are holographic signs that say "Welcome to the Franklin Institute" as you walk by them they change languages.

<p>This is my fifth year working Camp-in at the <a href="http://fi.edu/">Franklin Institute</a>.  I noticed every year that I would spend a significant amount of time giving directions to campers to nearly no avail. The problem is this - your average person loses track of what you've told them after about three rights and a left.  Myself, if you try to tell me the steps of a process, my brain takes a break after about five steps.  What would have helped in this endeavor is signs.  Nothing.  The signage in the museum was always dismal at best.  </p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.sba.gov/test/wbc/docs/chart_courses/signs.html">A visible, readable sign, can make the difference between profit and loss for your business. Many businesses attribute a large percentage of their business to their signs.<br /><a href="http://www.sba.gov/test/wbc/docs/chart_courses/signs.html">Small Business Administration - Women's Business Center</a></blockquote>
<img src="http://veryraw.com/images/medium/tfisignage01.jpg" style="float:right;padding:5px 0 5px 5px;" /><p>This statement could be applied to the museum's environment.  The success of the museum depends on patrons getting to see what they came to see.  After five years working there I know the halls and stairs and elevators in  a coma.  That's after five years.  Every stairway and elevator leads to a different section of the building.  Third floor on this elevator takes you to staff only areas.  On that elevator third floor leads to exciting exhibits.  There was never a difference to visitors because nothing was there to notify them.</p>
<p>That all changed this year.</p>
<p>The signs started appearing slowly in the beginning of this Camp-in season and over the course of this year have taken over.  I don't think that I've been asked for directions once; the signs take care of it. </p>
<p>If you look at the first sign here (from the main elevator), there's a different color for each floor.  A trend that continues throughout.  They are basic and clean, simple and clear.</p>
<p><img src="http://veryraw.com/images/large/tfisignage06.jpg" /></p>
<p>Whats more is they're modular.  The sign above is a perfect example of this.  On the third floor Moneyville is on the sign.  Moneyville is a traveling exhibit that will only be at the museum for a little while.  When <a href="http://www.bodyworlds.com/en/pages/home.asp">Body Worlds</a> comes toward the end of the year, they'll be able to swap out Moneyville for Body Worlds.  The signs are built from many little signs.  Very ingenious.</p>

<p>This principle is applied in other places like the observatory.  If it's closed they post the closed sign.  If it's open, the open sign.</p>

<p>If you've ever given directions at the museum you know that they all involve the Pendulum Staircase.  Boldly labeled.  So important.  These stairs will take you anywhere.  So important to label them.</p>
<p><img src="http://veryraw.com/images/large/tfisignage03.jpg" /></p>
<p>What I like most about the signs though is the iconography.  Every exhibit or area has its own icon.  They are simple, just white shapes and outlines, but they are descriptive.  I personally have a strong affinity for the sultry Ben Franklin icon used for the memorial.</p>
<p>I asked around and the king's gold  goes to Jeanne Maier and Jacey Stroback for this excellent signage.  I haven't met either one of these marvelous designers but thought I would mention them and rave.</p>
