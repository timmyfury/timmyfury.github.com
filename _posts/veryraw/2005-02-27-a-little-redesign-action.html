      Hey Tim,
         I agree with code. Its really hard to read. My eyes hurt. Do I still own half of that skull? That skull makes the site look redneck. I guess delicious is links to specific articles and stuff is perm. links?? Don.

    content: The design looks pretty cool.  I like it.  Except for the Gi-normous titles.  Well, we just got back from caves and the biggest observatory in the world, so I'm going to find everybody.  Have fun with your snow!

    content: I like the blue... subtle, but makes it a lot easier on the eye.  I also like the doubled up menu.  Again, subtle, but different.

    content: Looks good, and yes, very minimalistic (is that a word?). I do like the 2 right columns, but some formatting to the list items (which I'm sure you are planning) will go a long way on readability. Getting everything out of Times would be nice. And I want a skull like that to put on the hood of my truck. Hook me up.

    content: The skull hangs above my desk.  It was purchased in San Antonio, Texas in March of 2001.  Don, Burn and I went down to visit Code when he finished Air Force basic training.  At the time we all lived together and each paid a third of the cost.  I don't remember whether I ever bought their stock in the skull before we moved out.  There are tons of them for sale on <a href="http://search.ebay.com/skull-horns_W0QQfnuZ1" rel="nofollow">ebay</a> though.

Well I said I would wait for a little while to upgrade to <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2005/02/strayhorn/">Wordpress 1.5</a>.  The problem with that is that I was burning to test out a few new plugins for it.  Plus I had read a bit about the templating system in 1.5.  The theme system is amazing.  You make a theme and then it becomes transportable.  Pretty wild.  I'll be interested to see how it ports to the old versions of wordpress after I try to make a theme based on the old design. If I can get it to work then I can upgrade <a href="http://debra.veryraw.com/">Debbie's</a> blog too without being forced to spend any time redesigning her's too.

I was going to spend alot of time on this redesign.  I was going to attempt some amazing graphical feats.  I was.  But I got a little tired of sitting here working on it.  Plus I liked the minimalist thing that I've got going on here.  I still have some things to address.  The comments are not looking nice. I think I want to address the way the side menus are looking.  I haven't even used the page part of wordpress 1.5 which is the part I was most excited about. So the point is this.  The sites not finished.  Anyone who has been following my blog for any amount of time knows that it changes like every 5 seconds.

Let me know what you think.  Gimme feedback.  Tear it up.  Tell me what you love but more importantly what you hate.  Thanks.
