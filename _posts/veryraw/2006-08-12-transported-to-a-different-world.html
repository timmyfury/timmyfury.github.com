    content: I bought tickets for Chris as a birthday present and it was his first time seeing Cirque. I love it for all the same reasons you do, it's just a completely different type of performance than anything else. I probably never would have gone if I hadn't won tickets to Varekai three years ago, but now I want to go as often as I can. Hopefully next year I'll have enough loot to splurge for the VIP seats!

<p>Trish and I saw <a href="http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/CirqueDuSoleil/en/showstickets/quidam/intro/intro.htm">Quidam</a> last night.  It was an amazing show.  I have been to the circus many times in my life.  I've seen Ringling Brothers six times and Circ du Soleil twice.  I enjoy Ringling Brothers.  Its fun but after seeing Circ du Soleil, it just can't match up.  The thing that makes Circ du Soleil so amazing is that once you are in the tent, you get transported to a different world.  The experience is all encompassing.  The music and the lighting and the set all work together to pull you away form reality and into whatever world of fancy they are trying to create.  For the time that you are in the tent, you forget everything except whats going on on stage.  Circ du Soleil recreates the feeling that I love about my favorite books; being pulled away temporarily to another place.</p>
<p>If you ever have a chance to see Circ du Soleil I can't emphasize enough how much its worth the money to see the show.</p>
