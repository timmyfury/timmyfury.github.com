<p>There's nothing in the world I hate more then an animated gif, but I just had to make this one when I saw the two pictures on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bratacious/">Michelle's flickr page</a>.  It's two images of me at South of the Border.  You know I can never turn down a chance to dry hump something.</p>
