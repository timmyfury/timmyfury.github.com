    content: I found another hole in information security.... Microsoft's terra server has been hosting satellite imagery of the USA for years. I found another way to access all the information in the world from any phone, its an analog modem... its dangerous and should be destroyed.

      If you use Google Maps, the terrorists have already won.
      I call Godwins on myself, but the last 2 times that things were this bad (patriotism and fear as a way to limit freedoms) were McCarthy era US and Nazi Germany.
      Any spelling errors due to the fact that I am packing

    content: Great! Now Google and NASA are <a href="http://www.google.com/press/pressrel/google_nasa.html" rel="nofollow">teaming up</a>.  Next we'll be able to see satellite images of Mars and the moon and stuff.  Looks like the war on terror has a new front.

      "Google maps has simply given every person with access to a computer and an internet connection the ability to see it for free."
      
      I think this is the key thing to remember, really; there are a lot of things available on the internet that have people's panties all in a bunch, but much of it is already available to anyone with access to city archives or to the local public library. The internet only gives us the convenience that wasn't there before. Anyone with enough resolve to get this information can get it through a variety of other means.

title: The rediculous idea that Google maps could be used as a tool for terrorists
published: false

<p>Since Google added <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?t=k">satellite images to Google maps</a> and moreso since they released <a href="http://earth.google.com">Google Earth</a> I have read a glut of articles about <a href="http://www.mcwetboy.net/maproom/2005/09/google_earth_privacy_and_security_roundup.phtml">politicians freaking over the ability for terrorists to use the maps to collect information to plan an attack</a>.  The idea is rediculous.  Maps may be a useful starting place but saying that a terrorist could get the information needed to plot an attack from a low quality satellite image is like saying a research scientist could find everything they need in an encyclopedia.  I don't know if they realize it but maps have been available to the general public for decades.  I have several maps sitting next to my desk right now.  Not only do they have very detailed information about the US and the world but they can also be carried around where ever I go.  I don't even need google maps. </p>
<p>The whole idea strikes me as wreaking of two problems.  The first is the blatant overuse of the terrorist threat.  Its politicians preying on the fears of their citizens.  Its politicians making a sad attempt to convince their constituents that they are doing something when most of us know that politicians do nothing but fuel the bureaucracy of the government.  Second it shows how little politicians understand about the direction that the future is heading and the impact technology is going to have on it.  Google maps has not provided access to previously secret information.  Google maps has  simply given every person with access to a computer and an internet connection the ability to see it for free.  Nothing new here. </p>
