<p>August 3, 2004.  The day I registered for <a href="http://www.audioscrobbler.com/user/timmyfury/">Audioscrobbler</a>.  What's Audioscrobbler you ask?   It's a service that creates a profile of your musical taste.  I registered shortly after properly tagging all of my (now 9,641) mp3's using <a href="http://musicbrainz.org/">MusicBrainz</a>.  Initially I did it to be able to utilize the iPod which I had then not purchased.  Audioscrobbler was just an added bonus.</p>

<p>I recently cracked 7,000 songs on my Audioscrobbler profile.  If you look at the profile you will notice a few things.  By the weekly statistics you will notice that I listen to the same bands over and over again.  I may have alot of music but generally I cycle through a lot of the same stuff.  The most notable thing that you'll see though is although I have a pretty varying taste in music, Tom Waits appears to be by far my favorite musician.  I suppose that although I am a whore for a good break beat, I can't get enough of this crooner's twisted melodies.</p>

<p>I am recommending to all who read my site and enjoy listening to music as they while away their youth, sign up for this service.  It's simple and fun, you can add people as your friends and get music recommendations.  You can create and join groups.  You can be like me, a slut for data and statistics.  I liked it enough I even donated and got the sexy little plus sign next to my name.  Go.  Do it.  And tell me what your profile name is so I can add you as my friend.</p>
