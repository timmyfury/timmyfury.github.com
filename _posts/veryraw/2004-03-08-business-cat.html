<p>Every morning I wake up and go into the bathroom and take a shower. When I   am finished and am heading to my room to get dressed the cat is sitting on the   floor about three feet from the door outside of the bathroom. He waits until   I leave the bathroom then he strolls in. </p>
<p>I came to the realization this morning that the cat has a full-time job. There's no other reason for him to be awake that early. I mean come on, he's a cat.   Why else does a cat get up that early and wait for the bathroom. He needs to shit and shower before work. I think one of these days I am going to wait around   instead of leaving for work as soon as I am ready. I want to see him stroll   out of the house in his suit carrying his briefcase. He'll probably be scarfing down a quick breakfast as he rushes out to an important bussiness meeting. </p>
