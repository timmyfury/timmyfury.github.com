	<h3>Deeper Into Madness</h3>
	<p>I live in a house, near Phildelphia, <a href="http://operationdandelion.com">surrounded by dandelions</a> with my <a href="http://trisheller.com">wife</a>, two dogs, and our cat. I <a href="http://eatingcrowe.com">cook</a>. I have a secret obsession with <a href="http://cantyshanty.com">interior design</a>.</p>
	<p>I'm a web journeyman in the Philadelphia area. I've been paid to write Javascript, Ruby/Rails, Python/Django, HTML, CSS, PHP and C#/.Net. I've worked at many of the best interactive companies in the Philadelphia area including <a href="http://happycog.com">Happy Cog</a>, <a href="http://www.empathylab.com/">Empathy Lab</a> and <a href="http://electronicink.com/">Electronic Ink</a>. I am currently part of the product team at <a href="http://www.ticketleap.com/">TicketLeap</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="other-crap">
	<h3>Other Crap I've Done</h3>
	<p>I squat more domains than your average idiot should. Some of my favs include <a href="http://operationdandelion.com">Operation Dandelion</a>, a site devoted to my endeavors into eco-bastardry, <a href="http://bananusinfo.info">Bananus Info</a>, an informational site to warn people about the bananus and <a href="http://cantyshanty.com">Canty Shanty</a>, my occasionally updated collection of home improvement inspiration.</p>

<!-- <div class="section" id="old-stuff">
	<h3>There Used To Be Other Stuff Here</h3>
	<p>I wrote my first blog entry on this site in [[year]]. I used to host a lot of stuff that I created when I was first getting started in the industry. I still have it all. Some of it will never see the light of day again. Some of it will crop up here eventually. If you are interested charting how technology drove me deep into madness, you can <a href="/veryraw.html">read the old articles</a> and <a href="/animations.html">watch my animations</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="about-the-site">
	<h3>About the site</h3>
	<p>The site is generated using <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>. It's amazing and removes all the bloated cruft that I hate about content management systems. Use it, love it and worship its creator. I host the site using <a href="http://github.com/">github</a> pages.</p>
	<p>I'm a developer. I make very ugly things without the help of a beautiful mind. This jawn was designed by the lovely and talented <a href="http://joshnittle.com/">Josh Nittle</a>.</p>
	<p><a href="http://typekit.com/">TypeKit</a> serves up my heading fonts, they use <a href="http://processtypefoundry.com/fonts/klavika/">Klavika</a>.</p>
