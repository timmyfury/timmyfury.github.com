	<h3>There Used To Be Other Stuff Here</h3>
	<p>I wrote my first blog entry on this site in [[year]]. I used to host a lot of stuff that I created when I was first getting started in the industry. I still have it all. Some of it will never see the light of day again. Some of it will crop up here eventually. If you are interested charting how technology drove me deep into madness, you can <a href="/veryraw.html">read the old articles</a> and <a href="/animations.html">watch my animations</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="about-the-site">
	<h3>About the site</h3>
	<p>The site is generated using <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>. It's amazing and removes all the bloated cruft that I hate about content management systems. Use it, love it and worship its creator. I host the site using <a href="http://github.com/">github</a> pages.</p>
	<p>I'm a developer. I make very ugly things without the help of a beautiful mind. This jawn was designed by the lovely and talented <a href="http://joshnittle.com/">Josh Nittle</a>.</p>
