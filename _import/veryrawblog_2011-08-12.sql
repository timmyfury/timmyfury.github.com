Theres no question or comment to be made about it.

Whether a band is popular or not has nothing to do with the quality of their music. I like a lot of pop. \r\n\r\nJust a note a symphony play what is paid to to play. Additionally, I see your stuck in that \"Hey, check it out it\'s classical music but it\'s still rock and roll! This rules and legitimizes my taste! Nothing is musically more relevant and interesting than classical!\" Classical music is not the epitome of music, and what more a symphony plays what it is told and paid to play.

The IRS did have a debate about doing a public site of their own, but it wasn\'t just TurboTax who objected, probably. The compromise is that almost all major tax preparation vendors have a free-filing option, but each one develops its own qualifications for that program. The IRS site lets you find one that you fit.\r\n\r\nIf anything, Intuit deserves some credit for keeping the program going in the face of the new IRS flagging requirement:\r\nhttp://www.usatoday.com/money/perfi/taxes/2004-01-09-efile_x.htm\r\n\r\nOther vendors dropped out this year rather than open up their customers to extra scrutiny. \r\n\r\nThe problem the IRS has is not an easy one, as electronic filing is the method of choice for tax scammers, e.g. people who file for thousands of dollars in Earned Income Tax Credits to which they are not entitled -- for instance, by claiming a relative as a dependent. Scammers can file, get a loan on the refund/credit, and disappear before an human eyes at the IRS catch the fraud.\r\n\r\nThat said there\'s a lot of problems with the free filing program from the consumer perspective:\r\nhttp://www.consumerfed.org/011603_IRSfree.html',0,'1',0,'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050225 Firefox/1.0.1 Mnenhy/0.7','',0),

On the morning of Feb. 20, he buys a new radio-CD player for his 17-year-old son Christopher\'s car. He pays the $114 installation charge with 57 crisp new $2 bills, which, when last observed, were still considered legitimate currency in the United States proper. The $2 bills are Bolesta\'s idea of payment, and his little comic protest, too.\r\n\r\nFor this, Bolesta, Baltimore County resident, innocent citizen, owner of Capital City Student Tours, finds himself under arrest.\r\n\r\nFinds himself, in front of a store full of customers at the Best Buy on York Road in Lutherville, locked into handcuffs and leg irons.\r\n\r\nFinds himself transported to the Baltimore County lockup in Cockeysville, where he\'s handcuffed to a pole for three hours while the U.S. Secret Service is called into the case.\r\n\r\nHave a nice day, Mike.\r\n\r\n\"Humiliating,\" the 57-year old Bolesta was saying now. \"I am 6 feet 5 inches tall, and I felt like 8 inches high. To be handcuffed, to have all those people looking on, to be cuffed to a pole -- and to know you haven\'t done anything wrong. And me, with a brother, Joe, who spent 33 years on the city police force. It was humiliating.\"\r\n\r\nWhat we have here, besides humiliation, is a sense of caution resulting in screw-ups all around.\r\n\r\n\"When I bought the stereo player,\" Bolesta explains, \"the technician said it\'d fit perfectly into my son\'s dashboard. But it didn\'t. So they called back and said they had another model that would fit perfectly, and it was cheaper. We got a $67 refund, which was fine. As long as it fit, that\'s all.\r\n\r\n\"So we go back and pay for it, and they tell us to go around front with our receipt and pick up the difference in the cost. I ask about installation charges. They said, \'No installation charge, because of the mix-up. Our mistake, no charge.\' Swell.\r\n\r\n\"But then, the next day, I get a call at home. They\'re telling me, \'If you don\'t come in and pay the installation fee, we\'re calling the police.\' Jeez, where did we go from them admitting a mistake to suddenly calling the police? So I say, \'Fine, I\'ll be in tomorrow.\' But, overnight, I\'m starting to steam a little. It\'s not the money -- it\'s the threat. So I thought, I\'ll count out a few $2 bills.\"\r\n\r\nHe has lots and lots of them.\r\n\r\nWith his Capital City Student Tours, he arranges class trips for school kids around the country traveling to large East Coast cities, including Baltimore. He\'s been doing this for the last 18 years. He makes all the arrangements: hotels, meals, entertainment. And it\'s part of his schtick that, when Bolesta hands out meal money to students, he does it in $2 bills, which he picks up from his regular bank, Sun Trust.\r\n\r\n\"The kids don\'t see that many $2 bills, so they think this is the greatest thing in the world,\" Bolesta says. \"They don\'t want to spend \'em. They want to save \'em. I\'ve been doing this since I started the company. So I\'m thinking, \'I\'ll stage my little comic protest. I\'ll pay the $114 with $2 bills.\'\"\r\n\r\nAt Best Buy, they may have perceived the protest -- but did not sense the comic aspect of 57 $2 bills.\r\n\r\n\"I\'m just here to pay the bill,\" Bolesta says he told a cashier. \"She looked at the $2 bills and told me, \'I don\'t have to take \r\n\r\nthese if I don\'t want to.\' I said, \'If you don\'t, I\'m leaving. I\'ve tried to pay my bill twice. You don\'t want these bills, you can sue me.\' So she took the money. Like she\'s doing me a favor.\"\r\n\r\nHe remembers the cashier marking each bill with a pen. Then other store personnel began to gather, a few of them asking, \"Are these real?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course they are,\" Bolesta said. \"They\'re legal tender.\"\r\n\r\nA Best Buy manager refused comment last week. But, according to a Baltimore County police arrest report, suspicions were roused when an employee noticed some smearing of ink. So the cops were called in. One officer noticed the bills ran in sequential order.\r\n\r\n\"I told them, \'I\'m a tour operator. I\'ve got thousands of these bills. I get them from my bank. You got a problem, call the bank,\'\" Bolesta says. \"I\'m sitting there in a chair. The store\'s full of people watching this. All of a sudden, he\'s standing me up and handcuffing me behind my back, telling me, \'We have to do this until we get it straightened out.\'\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile, everybody\'s looking at me. I\'ve lived here 18 years. I\'m hoping my kids don\'t walk in and see this. And I\'m saying, \'I can\'t believe you\'re doing this. I\'m paying with legal American money.\'\"\r\n\r\nBolesta was then taken to the county police lockup in Cockeysville, where he sat handcuffed to a pole and in leg irons while the Secret Service was called in.\r\n\r\n\"At this point,\" he says, \"I\'m a mass murderer.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, Secret Service agent Leigh Turner arrived, examined the bills and said they were legitimate, adding, according to the police report, \"Sometimes ink on money can smear.\"\r\n\r\nThis will be important news to all concerned.\r\n\r\nFor Baltimore County police, said spokesman Bill Toohey, \"It\'s a sign that we\'re all a little nervous in the post-9/11 world.\"\r\n\r\nThe other day, one of Bolesta\'s sons needed a few bucks. Bolesta pulled out his wallet and \"whipped out a couple of $2 bills. But my son turned away. He said he doesn\'t want \'em any more.\"\r\n\r\nHe\'s seen where such money can lead.

Chicago is currently very reasonable in terms of prices ($1.75 single fare w/ 25 cent transfer that lets you have 2 transfers w/in 2 hrs, including back on the line you started on), gets you all over the city, runs all night on some lines (no stupid El shuttle), goes to the airport, and provides me with a thing of beauty called the UPass every semester ($83 for *4 months* of unlimited transport -- sweet!).\r\n\r\nHowever, Chicago does have some ass slow busses, greasy windows, trash all around, bums peeing on El seats (yes...), and no bathrooms at all.\r\n\r\nBut the point here is that the system is about to change.  CTA is bleeding money every year.  They are begging IL for $$, which is prob not going to happen b/c the state doesn\'t like giving all the $$ to Chicago.  This week there is a public meeting to discuss 4 ugly alternatives, all of which increase prices and decrease service, including possibly eliminating overnight service, which would blow to say the least.  I\'m hoping something good happens.  I\'m willing to pay more $$ for what I consider to be a pretty good system, but would like to think that we are going to have some kind of state support miracle.\r\n\r\nBack to dissertation writing.

Unfortunately, the last runs are made shortly after 11 on the routes that run the latest... service is cut earlier on the other routes, you know, the un-important ones that don\'t run into Old San Juan... Oh well and then you have the fact that while some of the routes may have posted that they run every 10 minutes Monday to Friday, they actually only come by like once every 45 minutes... and because of this lack of service, the bus is already full when it pulls out of the terminal.  \r\n\r\nTry travelling around all day without a car in Puerto Rico...',0,'1',0,'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0','',0),

You can still apply labels in Picasa, as well as descriptions.  Personally, I\'ve dreaded losing a hard drive and all of my pictures - inside Picasa, you can backup ALL of you pictures either as a full Picasa-reinstall or images only.  Another workaround is to configure your Flickr account to receive pictures by email, and then to send you photos via Picasa/gmail to Flickr.

At some point I may want a backup of all those images I have sent to flickr but for now I want them archived and backedup and more immediately I want them described.  I thought that picassa would satisfy my needs but it didn\'t.  I was sort of a waste of time.  I ended up spending a bunch of time on sorting and it still wasn\'t easy to find images.  For looking at digital images I have to say flickr is far superior to picassa.  It just flows.  I should say it just flows for me.  It works like I work. \r\n\r\nAs for having bigger problems than photos if your house burns down, you may have more problems in the immediate but in the long run there is nearly nothing that you would lose (save the life of a loved one) that could not be replaced other than photos.  When photos are gone they are gone.  Couches or books or computers can be replaced.

I personally have 60 gigs of hi-res original images from the last five months alone.   When someone like me (or probably you) signs up for their premium service... they lose money on our account.  \r\n\r\nIt simply isn\'t a profitable idea to offer unlimited storage for free (which $25 might as well be) in the long term.  And profit is what drives Yahoo.  Period.\r\n\r\nWhy does this matter?\r\n\r\nBecause my tape drive doesn\'t make it\'s first general condition of use \"We reserve the right to modify or TERMINATE the Flickr.com service for ANY reason, WITHOUT NOTICE at ANY TIME.\"  (Emph added.)  \r\n\r\nMy tape drive is also not a Beta system which Yahoo is still on the fence about keeping up once the trial is over.\r\n\r\nYou always risk losing data... but trusting your memories to a stockholder held corporation makes less sense than worrying about a house fire and meteor hitting your bank at the same time.

It\'s a good bet they are breeding in a woodpile that\'s too near our house.\r\nBut I don\'t have another place to put the woodpile.  Some of these buggers get in the house. In particular they come inside in the fall.  I\'ve applied Sevin dust around the woodpile (it\'s in a shelter and does not get wet). Also, I go out at night and kill individual crickets with Raid or something similar. This keeps the population down. \r\n\r\nOn another site I just noticed two more ideas. (1) Use glue boards inside the house in dark cave-like places. Glue boards are just cardboard with a very sticky glue. This should get rid of individual crickets that stray into the house. (2) Sprinkle Borax dust near where they are breeding. Good idea!!! This is a little known idea. Borax dust kills cockroaches and a lot of other pests. As some have said, \"it cuts the bugs like glass cuts humans\". It really does. They lose fluids through the cuts and dehydrate and die. I\'m going to apply Borax powder right after I finish this note. I\'ve used it for other pests, and feel sort of stupid because I didn\'t think of it sooner.\r\n\r\nA by-the-way... you can make ant poison (sweet eating ants only) by blending Borax powder into Karo syrup.

Unless you have shares on your computer that expose directories with temporary internet information such as cookies or cached pages, he couldnt get your card to do so. What he was doing was borderline illegal, its not like he was setting up a direct line to permanently take advantage of your connection (ie:stealing cable). But he would never get prosecuted and you wont get a cop to arrest him, its about as serious as jay walking. Now if he was using your connection and thus your IP to perform illegal acts online he would be prosecutable... but you\'d have to catch him first. This would basically involve looking at your logs and finding his MAC address, every ethernet card\'s is unique so there you go.\r\n\r\nBTW, if you have shares, readable to everyone, that expose vital information thats what you should fix first.... thats just stupid.

All experts say the trick is to kill them outside the house. Apparently the ones that come inside just wander in through cracks. Kill them outside the the problem is gone.\r\n\r\nSo we sprinkled Borax (Boric Acid) powder around our woodpile.\r\nThat\'s where they seem to be hatching. It\'s under a shelter, dry, and near the house. Borax (sold as a roach killer) will kill most crawling insects.  I bought a large container of Borax (advertised as a roach killer) at a dollar store for $2.00 and sprinkled it generously around the woodpile in a band about 12 inches wide.  Then I sprinkled some flakes of dry oatmeal on top of the Borax to give the buggers something to eat and a reason to walk in the Borax. Contact with the Borax kills them... they do not have to eat it. There are now dead camelback crickets around the woodpile. I check every night after dark and the live cricket count is zero.  Before doing this treatment those critters were having a party out there every night.  We\'ve had no camelbacks in our home for about three weeks. None!!\r\n\r\nAfter 15 years of putting up with these things we seem to have a solution. And it\'s a cheap solution, too.\r\n\r\nOf course if you put the Borax in places were it will be wet from rain, this may not work at all.\r\n\r\nAnother thing we did was to sprinkle Borax on the threshold of basement doors that we seldom open. We have been convinced this is the place they have been coming inside.  There are now dead sowbugs and other dead creepy-crawly things on the thresholds along with the corpses of a few camelback crickets.\r\n\r\nThis turned out to be easier than we thought. We\'ve used Borax (Boric Acid) to kill roaches but until recently never thought about using it to kill camelback crickets.\r\n ',0,'1',0,'Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)','',0),

The themes of human story telling are ancient, and It\'s a very christan-centric idea to think that the bible, a mere 2000 year old book (new testament) was the first original story ever told. The old Testament is much older, but by no means of the sort of antiquity I am writing about.\r\n\r\nAs for the movie, it took me weeks to stop thinking about how bad it was. It was, to put it lightly, a poor movie. Try to hide behind that fact that it was meant for children; Shrek and Shrek 2 were also meant for children, but were excellent movies.\r\n\r\nThe fact of the matter is that the story could not carry the symbolism, and because of that weakness the symbols became overbearing.\r\n\r\nCongratulations, even a movie based on the bible can be a total shit pie.',0,'1',0,'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20050915 Firefox/1.0.7','',0),

We\'ve all experienced asking someone a question we were in fact stupid to be asking (like we just didn\'t read what the message said or clicked the wrong button), and the person we ask is, for some reason, in a bad mood or is busy. Then we\'ll often get a reply such as \"everybody knows that\", \"how can you not know this\" or \"figure it out for yourself\".\r\n\r\nWhen we\'ve got an answer such as that once or twice we quickly learn it might be better to change the way we ask. Rather than \"what does this mean? how do I do this?\" we say \"I know I\'m supposed to know this because everyone else seems to...\". People who know nothing about computers see \'everybody else\' knows things, and we don\'t know what is easy and what is not - what \'everybody\' knows and what only people like you would know.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow that is said - I don\'t pose questions like that so I can\'t say I know why some people do.

Now I live here in Mississippi and I\'ve started seeing thing in friends homes. Funnily enough we have none.. though it may be due to our three dogs and eight cats! ( GO Animal Power! Lol) Altough we dotn have them here I do dread going to visit releatives in Memphis who have them every where. I think these things are rejects of sort and must not be too tasty. I say this due to the fact my younger cousion once set about trying to feed a few to his pet lizards. Weeks went by and the crickets remained at one end of the cage and the lizards seemed to be rooted to the other in fear.

Now I dont worry as they seem to pretty much stay away from it . Later on I plan on getting my dad to take care of the massive crawl space under the house just to be safe.

It actually makes me nauseous to ponder how far this once magnificent country has slipped into mediocrity. When I was a young man, fifty years ago, you could mention just about anything: And America was best at that. Now we rarely lead the World in anything. We can still claim one title; America has become the World\'s Biggest Debtor Nation.\r\n\r\nBack then, America enjoyed the best health care, the best schools, and the best working conditions on Earth, while we worked less hours, made more money, and enjoyed a life style never before seen upon this planet.\r\n\r\nOur coal mines were producing more coal, our steel-mills smelting more iron, and our assembly-lines led the World in manufacturing beautiful automobiles, refrigerators, wash-machines, dryers, and the hoard of smaller appliances and gadgets (which eliminated most of the drudgery of our daily chores) and introduced us to the life-of-ease, we all now enjoy.\r\n\r\nNow, American High School Graduates rank only average (whether tested in Mathematics, World History, Language, Science or any other critical field of expertise) and compared with the test scores of students from other industrialized nations.\r\n\r\nOur so-called health care system stinks, it is without question, the most dysfunctional conglomeration of nonsensical laws bureaucrats have ever assembled. It assures illegal aliens and greedy politicians unlimited free health care, while it renders millions of hard \r\nworking, honest citizens, incapable of obtaining any kind of health insurance.\r\n\r\nThe new Social Security Drug Plan deducts a premium for drug insurance, which you can bet will raise every year, from the social security checks, of subscribers. [AARP just raised my premium from $25.25 to $28.50, a 12.87% raise for 2007.] A great many drugs are not covered by this new plan, and it only pays a maximum of about 70% on any drug, a lot less on most. When the total drug bill (what the retiree and the government pays) reaches $2250.00, Grandma gets cut off, has to pay it all herself, until her total drug bill reaches $3500.00. Obviously if Grandma can not afford her drugs, her bill will never get to $3500.00, so she will go without her drugs for the rest of the year. Of course the monthly premium will still be deducted from her Social Security Check. The drug companies formulated this drug bill, got it enacted, and only the drug companies are going to benefit from it. (Our government gives them the premiums.) In short, this Shaft Our Grandparents Bill is nothing but a multi-million dollar windfall for the drug companies.\r\n\r\n [AARP also broadened the gap between when they quit paying for Grandmaâ€™s drugs, and when they start paying again. During 2006 they quit paying when the drug cost reach $2250, and restarted at $3600, leaving a $1350 gap. In 2007 the gap will be extended to $1450.] \r\n\r\nThe above bill is sure not the worst medical bill our elected officials have ever enacted. It just happens to be the last that made me angry. Hundreds of anti-consumer bills and amendments are on the books, which benefit only the medical and or the drug industries. Foreign competition to American Drug Companies is nonexistent. If it was legitimized, we could import drugs from reputable foreign drug facilities, for as little as 10% of the extortion we are now forced to pay our American Drug Companies.\r\n\r\nSad to say, but the Medical Cartels and Drug Companies, with their unchallenged power, are not the worst villains when it comes to manipulating our government into giving them a license to gouge us. The international oil and gas conglomerates, the \r\ninterstate utility companies, railroad cartels, automobile and airplane manufacturing companies, the cable companies, international shipping cartels and a score of other business concerns all wield as much or more power over our Congress, Senate and \r\nPresident, than the drug companies do. \r\n\r\nBig Business is our real enemy. Big Business controls both our National and State Governments, and Big Business is the real reason America is losing ground on all fronts, the reason America is slowly but steadily slipping into mediocrity.\r\n\r\nThe companies mentioned above, along with a score of Countries and a hoard of other mighty forces, funnel billions of dollars annually into Washington, to influence the Republican and Democratic Party Leaders to legislate on their behalf.     \r\n\r\nThe leaders of the Democratic and Republican Parties, in the Congress and Senate, now have more control over their subservient Congressman and Senators, than a Marine General has over his troops. The Political Party Lords control the pac-money. And the pac-money is what decides who will get elected, or heaven forbid, smeared. The Political Lords canâ€™t just walk down on the floor and tell a congressman or senator that they are fired. But they can have anyone that fails to kowtow to the powers that be, ostracized, and rendered powerless. And by denying pac-money and support, they can keep anyone from being re-elected.\r\n\r\nIt is crucial to America\'s future that we, the voters, acknowledge that the Political Lords are running this country. When all the Republicans vote yea, and all the Democrats vote nay, our Congressman and/or Senators are not voting their conscience, and they sure aren\'t voting the way we want them to vote. They are voting exactly the way the Party Lords have decreed they vote. And folks thatâ€™s not Democracy, thatâ€™s flagrant Bureaucracy. If we are going to declare war, prudence behooves us to first learn all we can about our enemy.\r\n\r\nNow, I just pulled what I have written here off the top of my head. So if you find a mistake, donâ€™t get excited, it is not that important, the overall theme of this opinion is correct. And furthermore it is also correct that with a minimum of research, anyone can ascertain for themselves that this greatest of all nations, is rapidly slipping into mediocrity.\r\n\r\nAnd even the United States of America, the greatest nation that ever existed, can fall from within, if we continue to allow misguided politicians, to barter piece after piece of good government away to any group able and willing to pay for preferential treatment.\r\n\r\nI have been telling people for years; when in doubt always vati. But only in this last year has the urge to really push this concept become obligatory.\r\n\r\nActually, voting against the incumbents is a very viable method of straightening out what is wrong with America. The power of our vote is awesome, if used wisely. Many congressmen and senators win their seats by very small margins, less than 5%. So if just 5% of the voters would vati, we would probably retire near a quarter of our Senators and Congressmen. And you can bet we would get their attention. If as many voters vati-ed, as voted for Ross Perot in 1992, weâ€™d probably unseat about 75% of both houses. Very few politicians win their seats with an 18.9% margin.\r\n\r\nFolks this plan definitely has possibilities. Politicianâ€™s egos are all wrapped up in their positions. Actually the only thing in the World, politicians love more than pac-money, is their influential positions, their jobs. And on the very day our legislators learn that their electorate is actually threatening to vote them out of office, they are going to be magically stricken with a burning desire to legislate on behave of their constituency.\r\n\r\nThe only question left is, where are you going to place your loyalty, to the Political Parties that you have been blindly supporting, or to America? You canâ€™t serve two \r\nmasters, and be loyal to both. We have to take the power away from the Party Lords; to the extent that it allows our elected representatives to vote the way we tell them to vote. Or in thirty years you are not going to be able to tell the difference between Washington and the corrupt Government of Mexico, or for that matter, tell the difference between America and Mexico.\r\n\r\nI wrote this poem more than twenty years ago, and it reverberates my sentiment now as vibrantly, as then.\r\n\r\nVATI VATI\r\n\r\nAs Mighty Rome Fell, America Could Die.\r\nWhether It Falls Or Not, Is Up To You And I.\r\n\r\nI worried and stewed, but by-and-by,\r\ncame up with a plan, where you and I,\r\ncan put America the a road, to a brand-new high.\r\nJust blame the politicians, get blood in your eye,\r\nand vote against the incumbents. Vati, vati.\r\n\r\nNow just voting won\'t do it, we\'ve got to vati.\r\nThat\'s  v, a, t, i, with a long \"A\", and  long \"I.\"\r\nVote Against The Incumbents, and you vati.\r\nThings will never get better, until we vati.\r\nVote against the incumbents, Vati, vati.\r\n\r\nThere is no time, to just set and sigh.\r\nAmerica will fail, without you and I.\r\nThe time has come, we must do or die.\r\nWe must all vote, and we must vati.\r\nVote against the incumbents, Vati, vati.\r\n\r\nThings won\'t just get better, by-and-by.\r\nUnless the apathetic voters, you and I,\r\nhit those poles with blood in our eye.\r\nAnd not only vote, but wisely vati,\r\nVote against the incumbent. Vati, vati.\r\n\r\nWe must not buy, some political lie,\r\nthe America we love, is about to die.\r\nPoliticians no longer, serve you and I,\r\nbut all acquiesce, to the powers that buy.\r\nVote against the incumbents. Vati, vati.\r\n\r\nThe newly elected may want to serve you and I,\r\nuntil that powerful pac-money catches their eye.\r\nThen party loyalty becomes, their big lie.\r\nAs they vote with the Pac, for their piece of the pie.\r\nVote against the incumbents, Vati, vati.\r\n\r\nCongressmen and Senators are nigh as apt to die,\r\nas meet defeat at the poles, by you and I.\r\nThey know weâ€™ll vote forâ€™em, they donâ€™t have to try.\r\nAmerica is declining, as democracy goes awry.\r\nVote against the incumbent. Vati, vati.\r\n\r\nWaxing fat on the apathy, shown by you and I,\r\npoliticians became hogs, and Washington\'s a sty.\r\nBut we can change all that, in the blink of an eye,\r\nif we just get off our apathy, and dutifully vati.\r\nVote against the incumbents. Vati, vati.\r\n\r\nIf just one out of twenty, of us would vati,\r\nwe*d get nigh a forth of that Washington sty.\r\nNow that might he to few, to help you and I,\r\nBut weâ€™d darn sure make, the rest of them shy.\r\nVote against the incumbents. Vati, vati.\r\n\r\nAnd when; \"Foul, foul,\" the politicians cry.\r\nAnd charge that; \"great careers will sadly die.\"\r\nStand up and look them, straight in the eye,\r\nAnd vow; \"Losing only makes the truly-great try.\"\r\nVote against the incumbents. Vati, vati.\r\n\r\nFrom the County Coroner, to that Washington sty,\r\nif you donâ€™t love the incumbent, always vati.\r\nHelp turn America toward, a brand-new high.\r\nTeach your kids and your friends, they must vati.\r\nVote against the incumbents. Vati, vati.\r\n\r\nIf the state of America, makes you want to cry,\r\nthen help start a revolution, no one has to die.\r\nOur party loyalty sent elections go so far awry.\r\nAnd we can fix that error, just revolt and vati.\r\nVote against the incumbents. Vati, vati.\r\n\r\nPart your 2nd and 3rd finger; that \"v\" means vati.\r\nSend this to a friend, who you think will comply.\r\nLetâ€™s all band together and give\'em a black eye.\r\nVati, vati, and hearty bye-bye.\r\n\r\nGrandpa Nate @ Rawlins, Wyoming.\r\nAlso see: http://grandpanate.com\r\n[If you like this, copy it, and pass it on.]',0,'1',0,'Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; IEMB3)','',0),

They are simply given another category ID and are not maintained separate from post categories.</li>\n<li>The posts table now has a column of <code>post_type</code> that should help developers distinguish between posts and pages.</li>\n<li>Future posts now gain the <code>post_status</code> of &#8216;future&#8217; which eliminates the use of <code>NOW()</code> in all queries in the core. Plugin developers should follow suit.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>WordPress 2.1 is nearing the time when the codebase will be released for testing, but it&#8217;s not too early to get those plugins and themes tweaked for the release. There is a <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Spencerp/2.1alpha3_Plugin_Compatibility\">Codex page</a> where plugin compatibility is being tracked as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Editor&#8217;s note:</strong> If you stick to the WP APIs as much as possible you won&#8217;t run into plugin upgrade issues like this.</p>\n\";}i:2;a:12:{s:5:\"title\";s:23:\"WordPress 2.0.5 - Ronan\";s:4:\"link\";s:51:\"http://wordpress.org/development/2006/10/205-ronan/\";s:8:\"comments\";s:60:\"http://wordpress.org/development/2006/10/205-ronan/#comments\";s:7:\"pubdate\";s:31:\"Fri, 27 Oct 2006 23:17:01 +0000\";s:2:\"dc\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";s:4:\"Matt\";}s:8:\"category\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:4:\"guid\";s:51:\"http://wordpress.org/development/2006/10/205-ronan/\";s:11:\"description\";s:360:\"It&#8217;s new release time.

When you go to your admin it will give you a link to update your database.</p>\n\";}i:8;a:12:{s:5:\"title\";s:26:\"WordPattern (April Fools!)\";s:4:\"link\";s:53:\"http://wordpress.org/development/2006/04/wordpattern/\";s:8:\"comments\";s:62:\"http://wordpress.org/development/2006/04/wordpattern/#comments\";s:7:\"pubdate\";s:31:\"Sat, 01 Apr 2006 16:22:38 +0000\";s:2:\"dc\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";s:4:\"Matt\";}s:8:\"category\";s:19:\"DevelopmentReleases\";s:4:\"guid\";s:53:\"http://wordpress.org/development/2006/04/wordpattern/\";s:11:\"description\";s:377:\"On behalf of the WordPress community, I&#8217;m proud to announce a merger we&#8217;ve had on our minds since the first time we saw Dean Allen&#8217;s dog &#8212; WordPress and Textpattern are joining forces to create the greatest CMSMS ever, WordPattern. &#8220;WordPress and Textpattern: Two great tastes that taste great together.&#8221;\nAs with any great union, there [...]\";s:7:\"content\";a:1:{s:7:\"encoded\";s:1007:\"<p>On behalf of the WordPress community, I&#8217;m proud to announce a merger we&#8217;ve had on our minds since <a href=\"http://textism.com/oliver/daily/\">the first time we saw Dean Allen&#8217;s dog</a> &#8212; WordPress and Textpattern are joining forces to create the greatest CMSMS ever, <a href=\"http://wordpattern.org/\">WordPattern</a>. &#8220;WordPress and Textpattern: Two great tastes that taste great together.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As with any great union, there were compromises involved. &#8220;I&#8217;m going all-Georgia, all the time.

I decided to add an element into the romanian blogosphere, an element that might shake it up so badly that people wouldnâ€™t even know what hit â€˜em. And that element, my friends, is a blog corecting the language errors of other blogs. And a purpose I had: get the blog on the front page of the most visited blog in Romania, in under 1 month. To ruin the surprise, I managed to achieve my goal in just a weekâ€™s time. This is my story.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Being only a humble second year journalist, I wasnâ€™t (and am not) an authority in the field of grammar, semantics or linguistics in general. What I possesed was something that all of us have, but are to afraid to use it: better judgement, the ability to criticise other peopleâ€™s work or - more general - speak your mind.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">After countless days in which my wordpress domain remained in an incapacited, almost retarted form, I decided to act upon it. Assault it with my cunning plans to achieve undeserved popularity. First day came and gone and there were already 10 posts on my blog. I started commenting on peopleâ€™s posts, telling them an error had been detected (as if I was an R2-D2 wannabe, bent on world domination and mistake correction). Fairly quickly, more and more people started gathering on the site and commenting on my methods and expressing their concern regarding my identity. But I had bigger fish to fry. Good things come to those who wait.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Day two and more mistakes, more blogs and even more comments. People cheering, people verbally attacking me, as if I was the reason they had poor linguistic knowledge. Most mistakes were typos, but mistakes nonetheless.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">By day three, I had already visited about 30 different blogs started receiving vengeful comments. They would end up eating their words, as their blogs would appear on the front page.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Day four was rather important to the evolution of the blog and to fulfilling my dastardly plan to become famous in under a month. That day I discoved the blog stats, integrated in the wordpress dashboard. â€œMy god!â€ I thought, â€œOver 100 views/day?â€. I couldnâ€™t believe my eyes: people were actually reading this? Paying attention to it? â€œThen it canâ€™t be that hard to get to where I want.â€ I said.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Day five, day six â€“ I finally got an email address (loads of thanks towards gmail) and started responding to the people commenting on the site. And then everything came to pieces (or so I thought) on day six, where I myself have made an syntax error on my blog. That unleashed hell. I was quoted, corrected and put in my place. Hard. Then, out of the blue, a knight in shining armour came to my rescue: a tenth grade blogger approached me in a chatroom and we started talking about this and that-mostly about the (now) controversial blog. To my surprise, he posted an entry on his blog, stating that I had NOT made a mistake and that people were just over zealous (I was receiving mistakes via email, people were really hating other people and were demanding punishment!). Then, once again, this stirred up the romanian blogosphere and people were commenting left and right, bringing up the weirdest reasons why I should quit blogging (Just die; you suck et cetera).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">On the seventh day, I found out I had â€œtoo much free time on my handsâ€. But hey, I was a hit. The statistics said so. And statistics donâ€™t lie (do they?).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">All the fear and loathing came upon me on the eighth day, when I tried reasoning, via email, with a fellow that really had it in for me: â€œYour blog sucks. NO! YOUR B-L-O-G sucks! Read my lips, mister! It sucks. Nobody reads it. Shoot yourself.â€ Of course, those arenâ€™t his exact words, but keep in mind, he was a deluted poor youngster, to say the least. Me? I knew what I was waiting for and I was smart enough to wallow in my triumph. I had made it to the front page of the most read blog in Romania and the guy liked my idea. â€œGreat!â€, I said. â€œWhat now?â€</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Oh, and I thought I was off the hook. Boy, was I wrongâ€¦Podcasts! I was featured in an audio podcast on another blog. Not really pleasant things to hear about something youâ€™ve devoted a week of your life to, but hey, there is no such thing as BAD publicity, right? Turns out, the guy doing the podcast is an old buddy of mine, somehow time has split us up and we disconnected in the fog of time.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This is where my story endsâ€¦or at least, this is where Iâ€™ve gotten so far.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Conclusions?</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">1. Girls pay more attention to spelling and grammar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">2. One powerful man with a blog can make you or destroy you. (from the usual 100+ views/day, I ended up having 800+, which is no small potatoes where I come from).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">3. Scandal is good for advertising. If youâ€™re selling something, if youâ€™re trying to promote a book (or a blog), nothing will get people talking about it faster than a good scandal (if sex is involved, even better!).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">4. If your site/blog gets some advertising, then youâ€™re set. I havenâ€™t updated the darn thing in two days and visitors come pouring in, at the advice of people they can trust.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">5. The (romanian?) blogosphere is an organism. It reacts to every single change in the society herein.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As my purpose has been achieved, what is there left to do? What peak is left to triumph over? What giant awaits to be slain? Oh, the pity I feel for childish blog authors posting pictures of their cats and talking about how much their lives suck. Is this it? Are there no more things to talk about and dissect?</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">I check my blog stats for the last time today (910 views) and hope that tomorrow will bring me wisdom and courage to pursue my (other) goals. Bloggers everywhere, beware!</p>\";s:7:\"pubdate\";s:31:\"Sat, 30 Dec 2006 21:00:25 +0000\";s:2:\"dc\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";s:4:\"Mark\";}s:7:\"summary\";s:6667:\"<p><small>This is the Fifteenth entrant in <a href=\"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2006/11/13/wltc-blogging-essay-competition/\">The Blogging Essay Contest from WeblogToolsCollection.com</a> If you would like to participate, please email me your entry at mark at wltc dot net.

It was quite unexpected, in fact I had a misconception and a negative opinion about blogging at this time. I hit upon Wordpress while building an article management system for a friend, which introduced me to the real blogging.</p>\n<p>It was exactly what I was looking for, I could write without any restrictions. Being able to write such freely felt like driving on an interstate after driving on a desert road. There was more importance to my thoughts than to the language. No one could tear it apart because they did not like it. I could write what I wanted and the way I wanted it. The only restriction was to stay honest. Even if no one monitors you, it reflects out of your writings.</p>\n<p>I started writing regularly on my blog. I made some mistakes, but unlike the professional world, they were pardoned and I was encouraged to write more. Blogging is one exercise where you can explicitly realise that you learn something everytime you make a mistake. I liked that <strong>blogging made me think</strong>. Blogging empowered me to express myself, without any adulteration or corruption. However, blogging did many more things for me.</p>\n<p>I started reading a lot more, reading people more than blogs. I started looking for that person behind the article, usually written in the small font. As I read more I could build a relationship with that person. It was like peeking inside the author&#8217;s mind. I have able to connect and exchange thoughts with so many people, who probably are unreachable for me in the physical world. In a way, this has revolutionalized the way I read. It is no longer just one article that I read, I also read conversations on it. Every single happening in the world had a reaction in the blogosphere, and sometimes the blogosphere has an impact on that event.</p>\n<p>I no longer read just books, I read what others think about the book, I discuss it with them and I learn more. I was pleasantly surprised to find that authors of a lot of books I read were blogging. And this included the greats of software development. Their blogs were probably more valuable than those books because they reflected their thinking and was dynamic with time. I follow blogs of books, I follow blogs of authors and I follow blogs of readers. I have started to discover much better books to read through this.</p>\n<p>More reading meant I got more information. I realised that I was better updated than earlier. I tried to make sure that I knew about what was happening inside the industry. It made me realise that industry news does not come from press releases, it comes from individuals. Reading these individuals is important because it made me someone inside the industry, which helped me in taking well-informed decisions.</p>\n<p>As I changed jobs I realised that my blogging could easily be irrelevant to them. Blogging is my own, personal, not owned by anyone else. This was the biggest advantage to me. I could do <em>out of job thinking</em>. It is quite natural to think about your field from your job&#8217;s perspective, and this creates limitations. As I kept blogging about software development I understood it more from a higher platform, and it did not change with every job or project I changed. I could keep building on it, which today has turned into a treasure for me.</p>\n<p>The technology involved in blogging helped me converse with other people. The comments, the pingbacks, the trackbacks all helped. The fact that I could just press one button and open up to anyone and everyone on the Web made it so easy. This was not possible in the physical world, we are always limited by various boundaries, which very easily disappeared on the Web. When I started working from home, blogging provided me some of the war rooms and the brainstorming sessions.</p>\n<p>Of course, blogging also has its own anxious moments. I got too obsessed with statistics earlier, but eventually realised the only thing I wanted to gain out of blogging was <a title=\"From Fear To Satisfaction\" href=\"http://ifacethoughts.net/2006/08/29/from-fear-to-satisfaction/\">expressing myself</a>; everything else was secondary, including commercialising it. This also consumed a lot of my time, and initially it was not easy to balance. Eventually I could find solutions using technologies like feeds. I think blogging will always take one with surprise, it has so much potential hidden that it can be too much to digest at the first instance. But eventually it only enriches you.</p>\n<p>People are putting them to various uses - from social causes to businesses to alarm the world of incidents which otherwise would have been hidden under rubble of the mainstream media. Blogging has had such an impact and quite regularly there is some hate-mail from someone in the mainstream media. This, in spite, of the fact that both are quite different and are not in competition. But blogging has been more effective in bringing out news of individuals, and news by individuals.</p>\n<p>There is another benefit of blogging, which makes me smile when someone googles for my name. My blog is my identity on the Web. I am truly on the Web, I am discoverable and I am reachable. This has far reaching impacts on my life in the physical world. Not only does it increase my equity, but it also makes me smile when I get an email from an old friend saying &#8220;you are all over the web&#8221;. My friends have found it easier to find me because of my blog.</p>\n<p>Blogging makes methink, it helps me express myself, it helps me learn, it helps me connect with people, it helps me stay informed. I try to write regularly on my blog, at least once a day. I will suggest you to give it a try if you have already not picked it up, it can turn out to be an extremely valuable asset for you.\n</p>\";s:7:\"pubdate\";s:31:\"Thu, 28 Dec 2006 17:45:22 +0000\";s:2:\"dc\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";s:4:\"Mark\";}s:7:\"summary\";s:8260:\"<p><small>This is the fourteenth entrant in <a href=\"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2006/11/13/wltc-blogging-essay-competition/\">The Blogging Essay Contest from WeblogToolsCollection.com</a> If you would like to participate, please email me your entry at mark at wltc dot net.

It was like peeking inside the author&#8217;s mind. I have able to connect and exchange thoughts with so many people, who probably are unreachable for me in the physical world. In a way, this has revolutionalized the way I read. It is no longer just one article that I read, I also read conversations on it. Every single happening in the world had a reaction in the blogosphere, and sometimes the blogosphere has an impact on that event.</p>\n<p>I no longer read just books, I read what others think about the book, I discuss it with them and I learn more. I was pleasantly surprised to find that authors of a lot of books I read were blogging. And this included the greats of software development. Their blogs were probably more valuable than those books because they reflected their thinking and was dynamic with time. I follow blogs of books, I follow blogs of authors and I follow blogs of readers. I have started to discover much better books to read through this.</p>\n<p>More reading meant I got more information. I realised that I was better updated than earlier. I tried to make sure that I knew about what was happening inside the industry. It made me realise that industry news does not come from press releases, it comes from individuals. Reading these individuals is important because it made me someone inside the industry, which helped me in taking well-informed decisions.</p>\n<p>As I changed jobs I realised that my blogging could easily be irrelevant to them. Blogging is my own, personal, not owned by anyone else. This was the biggest advantage to me. I could do <em>out of job thinking</em>. It is quite natural to think about your field from your job&#8217;s perspective, and this creates limitations. As I kept blogging about software development I understood it more from a higher platform, and it did not change with every job or project I changed. I could keep building on it, which today has turned into a treasure for me.</p>\n<p>The technology involved in blogging helped me converse with other people. The comments, the pingbacks, the trackbacks all helped. The fact that I could just press one button and open up to anyone and everyone on the Web made it so easy. This was not possible in the physical world, we are always limited by various boundaries, which very easily disappeared on the Web. When I started working from home, blogging provided me some of the war rooms and the brainstorming sessions.</p>\n<p>Of course, blogging also has its own anxious moments. I got too obsessed with statistics earlier, but eventually realised the only thing I wanted to gain out of blogging was <a title=\"From Fear To Satisfaction\" href=\"http://ifacethoughts.net/2006/08/29/from-fear-to-satisfaction/\">expressing myself</a>; everything else was secondary, including commercialising it. This also consumed a lot of my time, and initially it was not easy to balance. Eventually I could find solutions using technologies like feeds. I think blogging will always take one with surprise, it has so much potential hidden that it can be too much to digest at the first instance. But eventually it only enriches you.</p>\n<p>People are putting them to various uses - from social causes to businesses to alarm the world of incidents which otherwise would have been hidden under rubble of the mainstream media. Blogging has had such an impact and quite regularly there is some hate-mail from someone in the mainstream media. This, in spite, of the fact that both are quite different and are not in competition. But blogging has been more effective in bringing out news of individuals, and news by individuals.</p>\n<p>There is another benefit of blogging, which makes me smile when someone googles for my name. My blog is my identity on the Web. I am truly on the Web, I am discoverable and I am reachable. This has far reaching impacts on my life in the physical world. Not only does it increase my equity, but it also makes me smile when I get an email from an old friend saying &#8220;you are all over the web&#8221;. My friends have found it easier to find me because of my blog.</p>\n<p>Blogging makes methink, it helps me express myself, it helps me learn, it helps me connect with people, it helps me stay informed. I try to write regularly on my blog, at least once a day. I will suggest you to give it a try if you have already not picked it up, it can turn out to be an extremely valuable asset for you.\n</p>\";}i:17;a:7:{s:5:\"title\";s:46:\"Weblog Tools Collection: WP Widget: Nike+ iPod\";s:4:\"guid\";s:73:\"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2006/12/28/wp-widget-nike-ipod/\";s:4:\"link\";s:70:\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/weblogtoolscollection/UXMP/~3/67692474/\";s:11:\"description\";s:189:\"<p><a href=\"http://www.crustybugger.com/blog/?p=10\">WP Widget: Nike+ iPod</a> Display your <a href=\"http://nikeplus.com\">Nike+</a> listening list on your Wordpress blog with this widet.</p>\";s:7:\"pubdate\";s:31:\"Thu, 28 Dec 2006 17:30:33 +0000\";s:2:\"dc\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";s:4:\"Mark\";}s:7:\"summary\";s:189:\"<p><a href=\"http://www.crustybugger.com/blog/?p=10\">WP Widget: Nike+ iPod</a> Display your <a href=\"http://nikeplus.com\">Nike+</a> listening list on your Wordpress blog with this widet.</p>\";}i:18;a:7:{s:5:\"title\";s:47:\"Weblog Tools Collection: WP theme: WP-Andreas00\";s:4:\"guid\";s:75:\"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2006/12/28/wp-theme-wp-andreas00/\";s:4:\"link\";s:70:\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/weblogtoolscollection/UXMP/~3/67692475/\";s:11:\"description\";s:280:\"<p><a href=\"http://andreasviklund.com/blog/webdesign/new-wordpress-theme-wp-andreas00/\">WP theme: WP-Andreas00</a> Three column, lightweight, theme for Wordpress with widget support in both left and right columns from <a href=\"http://andreasviklund.com/\">Andreas Viklund</a>. </p>\";s:7:\"pubdate\";s:31:\"Thu, 28 Dec 2006 17:29:57 +0000\";s:2:\"dc\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";s:4:\"Mark\";}s:7:\"summary\";s:280:\"<p><a href=\"http://andreasviklund.com/blog/webdesign/new-wordpress-theme-wp-andreas00/\">WP theme: WP-Andreas00</a> Three column, lightweight, theme for Wordpress with widget support in both left and right columns from <a href=\"http://andreasviklund.com/\">Andreas Viklund</a>. </p>\";}i:19;a:7:{s:5:\"title\";s:35:\"Matt: Critical Look at Prototype JS\";s:4:\"guid\";s:51:\"http://photomatt.net/2006/12/28/critical-prototype/\";s:4:\"link\";s:51:\"http://photomatt.net/2006/12/28/critical-prototype/\";s:11:\"description\";s:478:\"<p><a href=\"http://abcdefu.wordpress.com/2006/12/27/prototypejs/\">Prototype.js != $()</a>.

Are there any more cultures that have such delicacy?</p>\n<p>On that same month I also wrote one of my longest pieces about my strained relationship with my <a href=\"http://claudiapena.com/2006/09/30/woman-where-are-you-now/\">mother</a> and took a political stand on the climate <a href=\"http://claudiapena.com/2006/09/28/hey-main-hey-man-you-got/\">fear</a> on my website.  I spent hours on the computer.  From the time I came home from work at 5 until midnight, I was writing, reading, searching, and revising so that the following day I would have a beautiful sacrificial lamb to offer to the gods of the internet while I awaited a signal.  My blogging became an Aztec ritual thirsting for the blood of words; pulling all nighters when creativity walked on my back like a featherweight sumo wrestler.  Until the signal came: a comment, a response.  Wow, I was silenced into shock.  No one other than family or friends had read my writing and of course they had to be positive, but a total stranger?  A total stranger in another city didn&#8217;t have to read, comment and much less be nice.  But there it was:</p>\n<p>Wow, that was nice, it was deep, and i can definitely relate to some of it, i remember mopping the floors at mcdonalds thinkin there&#8217;s got 2 be something better, i worked hard, made it somewhere and now it doesn&#8217;t seem betterâ€¦<a href=\"http://claudiapena.com/2006/09/30/woman-where-are-you-now/\">&#8211;A. Shunz</a></p>\n<p>My writing was like a delicate chocolate decadence cake eaten by total strangers and they LOVED it!  I slowly sank into the deep hole of ego maniacal, self proclaimed importance and random sporadic thought addiction that spews forth into the world through the internet of those who called themselves bloggers.  In less than two months, blogging had done what MTV, Nintendo and Friends had been unable to do in years: glue me down to a screen awaiting the next comment or how many people had seen my website.  My webmaster/boyfriend informed me with a huge smirk that over 500 people had seen my website in the first month but that the majority of the hits came from my own IP address.  &#8220;You&#8217;re your own best customer, darling!&#8221; and he busted out laughing.  &#8220;But when I goggle myself I come up first!,&#8221; I retorted.   He laughed harder, &#8220;It&#8217;s all you, darling.&#8221;  And with that, I was banded from my website for 2 weeks so he could get an accurate picture of the number of hits.  My addiction returned to a normal sitting down only 2-3 days a week with the occasional all night binges in front of the screen.</p>\n<p>To tell you the truth, it wasn&#8217;t until this contest that I realized that the word blog meant web log, an online journal.  (I was just overtaken when <a href=\"http://www.bloated.org/\">he</a> gave me the power of a website.)  What was even more interesting is that the word didn&#8217;t catch on until about 2003 in our dictionaries, and the earliest mention of it was in 1998 in Acronymfinder.com.  So, to humanity this concept of blogging is much more novel than deodorants to Europeans but has caught on faster than deo to bo for euros.  Why?</p>\n<p>First and foremost, there is a high demand for information both for the reader and author.  For the reader, yes it does serve the obvious purpose of getting to know the writer better.  However, a blog is a very personal intimate look at experiences and thoughts.  Reading about my mother, undocumented immigrants and Hispanic education, involves no financial transactions but does offer a very honest look at issues a reader has faced with difficulty at one point in their life.  There&#8217;s an aha! moment of relief or just gaining a new perspective.  Similarly, as a writer, if the reader chooses to leave a comment, I get a kick out of affecting people I&#8217;ve had no contact with ever in my life.  I want to write more if I know there&#8217;s someone reading it.</p>\n<p>Second, blogs are the Wal-Mart&#8217;s of the on line world: there are no restrictions to the format or content.  For a writer, this is heaven.  I don&#8217;t have to pretend I like anything in order to get published, nor do I have to search a great deal if I don&#8217;t want to.  Before, it used to be that if you felt political, you went to an online political forum, if you wanted to know a female&#8217;s experience birthing, you went to a gynological forum and so forth.  That was annoying and time consuming.  You are still at liberty to do that but it is nice to know I can go to someone&#8217;s website and get all that plus a story about animal rights.  With blogging, there&#8217;s no need to fragment your self.</p>\n<p>Third, don&#8217;t think a little ol&#8217; blog the size of plankton can&#8217;t bring down a whale.  Companies take commentaries on blogs seriously.  Just ask ihateshipley&#8217;s.com or KillerCoke.com who displayed all the injustices to Colombia&#8217;s population by the company.  Can&#8217;t find them?  Exactly.  Companies take blogging seriously and spend thousands of dollars on image control and lawsuits yearly.  Not only are individuals bringing companies to accountability, but also public entities like police departments.  After one person caught a police raid of Walters on Washington on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxKQb03A0bw\">camera</a>, there were several people who placed it on their website catching the attention of many <a href=\"http://blog.kir.com/archives/cat_news_houston_local.asp\">attorneys</a> and Houston business people.   Needless to say, Houston Police Department did a lot of backtracking afterwards.  Oh what the power of a blog can do!</p>\n<p>Fourth, the internet is faceless and, if you so wish it to be, nameless, making it the ultimate guerilla warfare battle ground.  Spammers (@#%!) as well as the average Joe who is getting screwed over with property taxes for a public school system where kids deal and cut lines in the middle of class can have a voice without reprimand.  Just look at Google school rankings and commentaries. Corporate world gives great fodder and as long as you remain anonymous with a secure job, people will not hesitate to blast a company or person by name.  The power of anonymity spills over even into the artistic, just look at <a href=\"http://postsecret.blogspot.com/\">postsecret.blogspot.com</a> where we view from the cheeky to the cruel, to the obviously insane truth about life.  What can&#8217;t you say if there is no reprimand?  The answer then becomes, anything your conscious doesn&#8217;t feel bad about (and when it does, just erase it).</p>\n<p>Last, with the exception of getting cozy with it in a bathtub or taking it to remote places where you should probably be worried about the mosquitoes more than the Hilton&#8217;s latest drug induced anorexia, what the hell can&#8217;t blogging do better than a traditional paper copy book, journal or magazine?  Plus it&#8217;s FREE!!!  Think about it, as writer I don&#8217;t have to wait for a haughty publishing company like Houghton Mifflin to read my manuscript, get back to me nine months from now, compromise my artistic vision, offer me the thrill of having a book as payment (maybe), become a pr person to promote sales and deal with all the red tape that I could really care less about as an artist.  I am taking it as I see it, when I see it and without anyone&#8217;s permission on my blog, so bite me Mifflers of the world!   And if I ain&#8217;t writing about it, I&#8217;ll be sure to support my friends who are.  Why should I have to go buy a book when I am already paying enough money for my high speed? The flexibility of bloggers and internet are becoming serious competitors to publishing houses, who have no choice now but to morph into e-books to keep up with the market.  (Don&#8217;t believe me, ask the four time bought and sold hot potatoe of <a href=\"http://americanfiction.suite101.com/article.cfm/houghton_mifflin_sold\">Houghton Mifflin</a>.)</p>\n<p>So take it form this newbie to blogging: blogging is the wave of the futureâ€¦You know we should have a bloggers&#8217; convention, just like a book convention.  That would be really neat.  Just a thought.  God loves the bloggersâ€¦wonder when the Catholic Church will come out with a special prayer for us.

Thank you.</small></p>\n<p><small>This is written by <a href=\"http://www.private-intellectual.de\">The Private Intellectual</a> </small></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s probably something which you hardly notice, something which is there, but also not there. You see it every single day of your waking life - some people even dream about it - and yet you don&#8217;t see it or, at least, it doesn&#8217;t register in the same way. Advertising is as much a part of our lives as eating and drinking: no matter where you are or what you are doing, there is something close at hand which is advertising a product someone wants you to buy. It could be in a magazine or newspaper, on a billboard or the side of a bus; it pops up whenever you visit a website and, in our open and commercial times, it is becoming an integral part of blogging.</p>\n<p>I use it myself. Everytime someone visits my weblog to read and praise (one hopes) the latest post, to leave a comment or attempt to insert a piece of advertising spam, there is a clear and obvious link to a commercial website. Every single page, every single entry brings this new form of advertising to the fore and attempts to catch the eye of the visitor, and draw their mouse over a wealth of interesting articles which, the advertiser feels, they really should take a closer look at and then purchase.<br />\nThe bulk of these advertisements have precious little to do with the blogger themselves. They sign up for some form of linked advertising - be it thematic or buzzword related - and then simply let the whole thing run. Some take a much closer interest in exactly what appears on their weblog, changing deals or bringing in specific words to force a link or, as in my case, insisting that only specific products may appear. Then there are those who have a much more subtle method of advertising; hidden within the text of an entry, perhaps, or linked with a write-up, a review or criticism.<br />\nIt is said - according to an advertisement on Technorati, as it happens - that there are roughly fifty-five million active weblogs at the moment: all vying for attention; all covering a multitude of themes from the most mundane to the highly technical, from guesswork to actual knowledge; all hoping to force their way up into the public consciousness and the Top One Hundred or better. Many of these bloggers will have read about the wonderful opportunities weblogs have to make their owners money; the careful writer, placing the right adverts prominently next to related entries, they claim, can make money hand over fist. It is virtually time to retire from the mundane nine-to-five world and retire to the virtual world of the Internet, where people will rush to your site merely to ensure you have enough commission coming in from the adverts you&#8217;ve placed here and there.<br />\nObviously, with so many weblogs, few stand a chance of coming anywhere near the Top One Hundred in Technorati&#8217;s rankings, or any of the other ranking systems. That, by a process of commonsense, means that few, if any, are going to be making enough money from advertising to retire early, if at all. Adverts are, after all, everywhere. Why should anyone wish to click on the adverts in this weblog or that weblog, when they probably have the main websites saved in their favourites already, and can click through to purchase and browse at their leisure? Few of the adverts we see on weblogs are out of the ordinary: Amazon, Barnes and Noble, ZVAB, eBay, Craigslist, ABEBooks. We know them already, we use them already.<br />\nAs with the technology behind weblogs, behind the Internet itself, advertising is going through a time of flux, of change and revitalisation. It is being modernised and new, subtler ways of bringing a specific message, a certain product are being brought before the public. The idea that there is nothing new under the sun hasn&#8217;t, perhaps, managed to sink in yet, but there is the belief that, while it may not be as new as some may wish to claim, the method is new to the medium and, as such, worth marketing as new. Advertising on weblogs is moving towards the hidden recommendation; the review or recommendation which has been paid for and doesn&#8217;t come out simply because a person genuinely appreciates a product, has used it themselves and given it as a present to someone more worthy than their mother-in-law. The recommendations have links within the text. Occasionally they have stock photographs - clearly not shot quickly on their webcam or digital camera and uploaded to the site - which show the product in the best possible light. Their recommendation is enthusiastic, but refined. No more of the teen- age gushing over the latest issue of Seventeen or the swarming of twenty-somethings over a wedding dress design in Cosmopolitan. The reviews are polished and careful. The links go to the main page for the item, and often contain a personal reference to the original poster. Links go to sites which require paid membership, or offer a service such as motor insurance, the latest CDs and DVDs, updated software and similar.<br />\nThe way ahead this coming year, it would appear, is the more subtle form of advertising. A blogger is given a product to review in more than one hundred words, provided with a link and, often, stock photography and a set fee for their work. Or the blogger picks out an opportunity with a set fee from a list and allows their work to be assessed, approved or denied. One might almost term it Freelance Advertising, a hit and miss form of journalism aimed at the consumer who, in some cases, shouldn&#8217;t realise that they are reading an advertisement in the first place.<br />\nThere are several sites which offer such services, moving away from Google and the other buzzword related advertising. ReviewMe or PayPerPost have both come to the fore of late and both operate a similar service. The former allows weblogs to be listed and rates them according to content and ranking: the blogger then waits for an advertiser to approach them. The latter functions the other way about: the weblog is registered and approved and then the blogger selects products (or opportunities) to review. In both cases the work is assessed by the middle-man first, the advertisers themselves have no say in the matter, which is where a denial can come into play. Advertising reviews must then remain on the weblog - although not necessarily on the front page - for a specified period of time before payment for the work is made.<br />\nRecently there has been a mild form of uproar over this style of advertising - meaning, several big names in the blogosphere have spoken out against or for the method and then moved on as a few others have linked to or copied their comments. The worry that such advertising might fool readers into honestly believing such reviews are genuine has caused a small change: at least one of the middle- men companies now insists that a Disclosure be published somewhere on the weblog; financial interests rather than a personal review.<br />\nPerhaps a storm in a teacup, perhaps genuine cause for concern. Either way, this form of advertising, being considerably more subtle than blocks of links in the sidebar, is likely to catch on. Perhaps it is also a form of future for the weblog itself and will evolve into  a business similar to that practised by many glossy magazines; whereby specific products are praised in long articles neatly placed next to the adverts for the same items, as if by chance rather than design. Perhaps it will evolve into real recommendations and honest evaluations in reply to the paid advertisments and give more bloggers something to write about, aside from their cat and complaints that no one leaves comments on their weblog. It is unlikely to bring anyone&#8217;s retirement closer than we all expect, but it might help boost the housekeeping now and then and, without a shadow of a doubt, it will evolve with time. This form of paid advertising will integrate itself into the blogospher just as comment spam has, just as Social Bookmark Icons have, just as tales of the woes of emotionally-disturbed teen-agers has.

Thank you.</small></p>\n<p><small>This is written by <a href=\"http://www.private-intellectual.de\">The Private Intellectual</a> </small></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s probably something which you hardly notice, something which is there, but also not there. You see it every single day of your waking life - some people even dream about it - and yet you don&#8217;t see it or, at least, it doesn&#8217;t register in the same way. Advertising is as much a part of our lives as eating and drinking: no matter where you are or what you are doing, there is something close at hand which is advertising a product someone wants you to buy. It could be in a magazine or newspaper, on a billboard or the side of a bus; it pops up whenever you visit a website and, in our open and commercial times, it is becoming an integral part of blogging.</p>\n<p>I use it myself. Everytime someone visits my weblog to read and praise (one hopes) the latest post, to leave a comment or attempt to insert a piece of advertising spam, there is a clear and obvious link to a commercial website. Every single page, every single entry brings this new form of advertising to the fore and attempts to catch the eye of the visitor, and draw their mouse over a wealth of interesting articles which, the advertiser feels, they really should take a closer look at and then purchase.<br />\nThe bulk of these advertisements have precious little to do with the blogger themselves. They sign up for some form of linked advertising - be it thematic or buzzword related - and then simply let the whole thing run. Some take a much closer interest in exactly what appears on their weblog, changing deals or bringing in specific words to force a link or, as in my case, insisting that only specific products may appear. Then there are those who have a much more subtle method of advertising; hidden within the text of an entry, perhaps, or linked with a write-up, a review or criticism.<br />\nIt is said - according to an advertisement on Technorati, as it happens - that there are roughly fifty-five million active weblogs at the moment: all vying for attention; all covering a multitude of themes from the most mundane to the highly technical, from guesswork to actual knowledge; all hoping to force their way up into the public consciousness and the Top One Hundred or better. Many of these bloggers will have read about the wonderful opportunities weblogs have to make their owners money; the careful writer, placing the right adverts prominently next to related entries, they claim, can make money hand over fist. It is virtually time to retire from the mundane nine-to-five world and retire to the virtual world of the Internet, where people will rush to your site merely to ensure you have enough commission coming in from the adverts you&#8217;ve placed here and there.<br />\nObviously, with so many weblogs, few stand a chance of coming anywhere near the Top One Hundred in Technorati&#8217;s rankings, or any of the other ranking systems. That, by a process of commonsense, means that few, if any, are going to be making enough money from advertising to retire early, if at all. Adverts are, after all, everywhere. Why should anyone wish to click on the adverts in this weblog or that weblog, when they probably have the main websites saved in their favourites already, and can click through to purchase and browse at their leisure? Few of the adverts we see on weblogs are out of the ordinary: Amazon, Barnes and Noble, ZVAB, eBay, Craigslist, ABEBooks. We know them already, we use them already.<br />\nAs with the technology behind weblogs, behind the Internet itself, advertising is going through a time of flux, of change and revitalisation. It is being modernised and new, subtler ways of bringing a specific message, a certain product are being brought before the public. The idea that there is nothing new under the sun hasn&#8217;t, perhaps, managed to sink in yet, but there is the belief that, while it may not be as new as some may wish to claim, the method is new to the medium and, as such, worth marketing as new. Advertising on weblogs is moving towards the hidden recommendation; the review or recommendation which has been paid for and doesn&#8217;t come out simply because a person genuinely appreciates a product, has used it themselves and given it as a present to someone more worthy than their mother-in-law. The recommendations have links within the text. Occasionally they have stock photographs - clearly not shot quickly on their webcam or digital camera and uploaded to the site - which show the product in the best possible light. Their recommendation is enthusiastic, but refined. No more of the teen- age gushing over the latest issue of Seventeen or the swarming of twenty-somethings over a wedding dress design in Cosmopolitan. The reviews are polished and careful. The links go to the main page for the item, and often contain a personal reference to the original poster. Links go to sites which require paid membership, or offer a service such as motor insurance, the latest CDs and DVDs, updated software and similar.<br />\nThe way ahead this coming year, it would appear, is the more subtle form of advertising. A blogger is given a product to review in more than one hundred words, provided with a link and, often, stock photography and a set fee for their work. Or the blogger picks out an opportunity with a set fee from a list and allows their work to be assessed, approved or denied. One might almost term it Freelance Advertising, a hit and miss form of journalism aimed at the consumer who, in some cases, shouldn&#8217;t realise that they are reading an advertisement in the first place.<br />\nThere are several sites which offer such services, moving away from Google and the other buzzword related advertising. ReviewMe or PayPerPost have both come to the fore of late and both operate a similar service. The former allows weblogs to be listed and rates them according to content and ranking: the blogger then waits for an advertiser to approach them. The latter functions the other way about: the weblog is registered and approved and then the blogger selects products (or opportunities) to review. In both cases the work is assessed by the middle-man first, the advertisers themselves have no say in the matter, which is where a denial can come into play. Advertising reviews must then remain on the weblog - although not necessarily on the front page - for a specified period of time before payment for the work is made.<br />\nRecently there has been a mild form of uproar over this style of advertising - meaning, several big names in the blogosphere have spoken out against or for the method and then moved on as a few others have linked to or copied their comments. The worry that such advertising might fool readers into honestly believing such reviews are genuine has caused a small change: at least one of the middle- men companies now insists that a Disclosure be published somewhere on the weblog; financial interests rather than a personal review.<br />\nPerhaps a storm in a teacup, perhaps genuine cause for concern. Either way, this form of advertising, being considerably more subtle than blocks of links in the sidebar, is likely to catch on. Perhaps it is also a form of future for the weblog itself and will evolve into  a business similar to that practised by many glossy magazines; whereby specific products are praised in long articles neatly placed next to the adverts for the same items, as if by chance rather than design. Perhaps it will evolve into real recommendations and honest evaluations in reply to the paid advertisments and give more bloggers something to write about, aside from their cat and complaints that no one leaves comments on their weblog. It is unlikely to bring anyone&#8217;s retirement closer than we all expect, but it might help boost the housekeeping now and then and, without a shadow of a doubt, it will evolve with time. This form of paid advertising will integrate itself into the blogospher just as comment spam has, just as Social Bookmark Icons have, just as tales of the woes of emotionally-disturbed teen-agers has. It is not the future of the weblog as such, but it is a part of that future.\n</p>\";}}s:7:\"channel\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";s:16:\"WordPress Planet\";s:4:\"link\";s:28:\"http://planet.wordpress.org/\";s:8:\"language\";s:2:\"en\";s:11:\"description\";s:47:\"WordPress Planet - http://planet.wordpress.org/\";s:7:\"tagline\";s:47:\"WordPress Planet - http://planet.wordpress.org/\";}s:9:\"textinput\";a:0:{}s:5:\"image\";a:0:{}s:9:\"feed_type\";s:3:\"RSS\";s:12:\"feed_version\";s:3:\"2.0\";s:5:\"stack\";a:0:{}s:9:\"inchannel\";b:0;s:6:\"initem\";b:0;s:9:\"incontent\";b:0;s:11:\"intextinput\";b:0;s:7:\"inimage\";b:0;s:13:\"current_field\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"current_namespace\";b:0;s:19:\"_CONTENT_CONSTRUCTS\";a:6:{i:0;s:7:\"content\";i:1;s:7:\"summary\";i:2;s:4:\"info\";i:3;s:5:\"title\";i:4;s:7:\"tagline\";i:5;s:9:\"copyright\";}s:4:\"etag\";s:25:\"\"1a9e6-459808c5-568c2a\"\r\n\";s:13:\"last_modified\";s:31:\"Sun, 31 Dec 2006 19:00:21 GMT\r\n\";}',20,8,'',1,'no');

	(10,1,'2004-11-01 08:02:31','2004-11-01 14:02:31','<p>While on my three month hiatus from blogging I purchase myself a bright shiny new <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ipod/\">40GB iPod</a>. The investment made me a little squeamish due to the $400 investment.  I himmed and hawed for months about the purchase but after selling my 1964 Buick Skylark, I had the money and though, â€œWhy the hell not.â€  So here I am with an iPod.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had the iPod engraved.  The back says, â€œThe Library of Alexandria, Operation Jail Time.â€  The source of this name is two fold.  The first part is what <a href=\"http://iam.thecolossus.net/\">Mark</a> and I have named our effort to archive all of our mp3â€™s.  The project is named after <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Alexandria\">the Royal Library of Alexandria</a> which held all of the secrets of the ancient world but was lost long ago in barbarian raids.  This name has two meanings.  The first is that it is an amazing collection of music, primarily electronic, and the second is that eventually, we are sure, that the barbarians of the <acronym title=\"Recording Industry Association of America\">RIAA</acronym> will get a hold of us and burn our library to the ground like the Huns they are.  Iâ€™ll write about the collection sometime in the future but this entry is dedicated to the iPod. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second part of the name plays into the idea that someday the <acronym title=\"Recording Industry Association of America\">RIAA</acronym> will find us and we will spend the rest of our lives paying off the fines that they bestow upon us.  â€œOperation Jail Time,â€ its funny, I\'m going to jail, laugh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As of this morning there are exactly 5500 songs on my iPod (Johnny Rebel free).  When I purchased the iPod I was listening to nothing but <acronym title=\"Natianl Public Radio\">NPR</acronym>.  The rest of the radio had become a vapid wasteland of trash.  I couldnâ€™t stand the incessant yammering about things I didnâ€™t care about.  The problem with listening to <acronym title=\"Natianl Public Radio\">NPR</acronym> was that I was also suffering from a mean case of outrage burnout.  This is the what happens when you are so tired of being pissed off about the status of the world that you cease to care.  Needless to say, I was tiring of <acronym title=\"Natianl Public Radio\">NPR</acronym> too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The iPod turned my life around.  Really.  After I purchased it I didnâ€™t mind the drive to and from work everyday.  Armed with music that fit with every mood I am always equipped for the drive ahead.  With the drive to and from becoming more pleasant, I was in a better mood when I got to work and performed better there.  This has happened in almost every aspect of my life.  Everything I do is more pleasant because I have the music to match the mood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although I was originally very apprehensive about spending as much money as I did on the iPod, I am glad that I did.  Now I realize that its probably the best investment I have ever made.  \r\n</p>','How iPod changed my life.',0,'',NULL,NULL,'publish','closed','closed','','ipod-changed-my-life','','','2004-11-04 23:10:21','2004-11-05 04:10:21','',0,'http://veryraw.com/history/2004/11/ipod-changed-my-life/',0,'','',1),

Then one day I realized that there was an entire world that I wasn\'t getting.  It seemed that there were stories that were never getting to CNN. I doubt that the problem is poor correspondents.  I think that they filter their news.  It\'s rather obvious when the most important things on the site deal with mainly Iraq and George Bush.  Now I\'m not saying that these topics aren\'t important.  I just think that there is alot more to life on this planet than Geo and Iraq.</p>\r\n<p>A few days ago I wrote about the <a href=\"http://veryraw.com/history/2004/11/bush-wins-we-all-lose/\">travesty of an election</a> that we had.  In that entry I mentioned Fox News.  I believe Fox News is close to the worst thing that has happened to the world.  Ever.  They select stories which are violent and depressing.  They take angles on stories with the main focus being whatever will get the masses to throw up there arms in discust at the condition of the world.  This counter-productive way of reporting the news misleads and causes things to happen like this most recent election.  I trully don\'t believe most of the country even realized that they knew that there were other important things happening in the world outside of terrorism. Organizations like Fox News are to blame for the destruction of intelligence and inquisitiveness in America.</p>\r\n<p>A few years ago there was an article in the <a href=\"http://www.delcotimes.com/\">Delaware County Daily Times</a>.  This paper is easily the most biased publication I have ever gotten my hands on.  I have read the <a href=\"http://www.cst-phl.com/\">Catholic Standard and Times</a> and felt like I was reading less propagandistic materials.  I digress.  The paper had an article about a man who was bitten by a badger.  The way they delivered the facts you would think the man was attacked by an elephant with a shark tied to its head.  This was, from what I saw, an attempt to get the people of Delaware County angry.  I could hear old and fictional  Mr. Jones on Poplar Street saying, \"We got to do sompthin about them dang badgers!\"</p>\r\n<p>Everyday this newspaper has articles in it about violent, depressing things.  When they actually do run an article about something good it\'s in the context of \'dag, in a world full of such hate and greed, there still are a few decent people left.\'  There are alot of decent people left.  But decent people don\'t sell newspapers, scumbags do.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Enter the alternatives...</h4>\r\n<p>After realizing that all of the news sources that I had been reading for almost two years at that point I dumped them. Dumped them like the hateful, misery seeking vultures they are.  But what was I to do.  An information addict like myself needs his fix.</p>\r\n<p>I have read recently that more young americans are turning to shows like <a href=\"http://www.comedycentral.com/tv_shows/thedailyshowwithjonstewart/\">The Daily Show</a> and <a href=\"http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/best_week_ever/series.jhtml\">The Best Week Ever</a> for their news.  I think this is a great turn.  You get all the same facts that you would anywhere else but you get multiple sides.  You also get a dose of humor which most people watching Fox News could use anyway.</p>\r\n<p>I think you should go further though.  If you are unsatisfied with the information you are getting then search deeper, search harder.  Find what you are aching for. When those get old dump them too.</p>\r\n<p>I have found that the best sources for information are the free ones.   People and organizations which don\'t profit from the information that they provide are the best source out there.  They give you everything and they give you truth.  Free thinkers provide free thinkers with free information that\'s real.</p>\r\n<p>For the weak and weary, for those tired of the crap that the Media Dishes us.  For those who hate the drivel of Fox News and the Delaware County Daily Times and all the money mongering whores like them around the country, I recommend you take a look at my \"Frequently Visited\" links on the side of the page.  This is where I find my best information.  Search out sites that provide you with what you want.  Oh and tell me about them because I am still searching.</p>','Alternate Information Sources',0,'',NULL,NULL,'publish','closed','closed','','alternate-information-sources','','','2004-11-09 21:48:20','2004-11-10 02:48:20','',0,'http://veryraw.com/history/2004/11/alternate-information-sources/',0,'','',8),

The new ICANN policy removes that protection. When we receive a request to transfer your domain name to a new registrar, we will still attempt to contact you to confirm that you authorized the request. However, if you do not respond, or are not able to respond within 5 days, your domain name WILL be transferred.<br />\r\n\r\nRest assured, your domains have NOT been transferred, and IT IS UNLIKELY that this will happen.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Although <a href=\"http://iam.thecolossus.net\">Mark</a> has stated how stupid this policy is, I disagree.  I have many times, particularly when I was looking for a new <acronym title=\"Universal Resource Locator\">URL</acronym> for my blog, ran into a case where the site wasn\'t doing anything but it was still registered. I wish I had saved the names of those sites for this exact circumstance.  My thought is that this policy has been changed at ICANN to help recover some of these <acronym title=\"Universal Resource Locator\">URL</acronym>\'s if they are wanted by someone else.  I think I am going to start trying to steal people\'s domains. You know... just for fun.\r\n</p>','Take my domain...

	(22,1,'2004-11-12 00:06:28','2004-11-12 05:06:28','<p>I need some help.  I created this thing last night and today I got alot of great feedback from specific people I have sent it to.  I need everyone\'s help now.  This could potentially save a lot of people the trouble of fixing other people\'s computers because it would give them a place to send them to find some information to help.  It\'s a windows security checklist.  It covers anti-virus software, pop-up blockers,  anti-spyware and some other stuff.  Leave me comments. Thanks.<p>\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<p>You can find a full, properly styled version of this page on my <a href=\"http://faculty.dccc.edu/~timothy/windowssecurity/\">dccc homepage</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h1>A few simple steps to a happier, healthier computer!</h1>\r\n\r\n<h2>What are we going to do?</h2>\r\n<p>Maintaining your computer is easy.  There are a few simple things which you can do to keep everything in proper working order. This list does not require any special computer wizardry.  I\'ve received a hundred kajillion request for assistance from people who are frustrated with what their computers are doing.  Follow these simple steps and you will find yourself a happy existance which is spyware free, spam free, and ad free. Be patient and don\'t get discouraged. Good luck.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What do I do?</h2>\r\n<h3>Run Windows Update</h3>\r\n<p>You will need to use Internet Explorer for this.  Open Internet Explorer, go to <a href=\"http://www.windowsupdate.com\">www.windowsupdate.com</a> They will most likely ask you a bunch of questions, for example, \'Do you trust Microsoft?\' or \'Do you want to give Microsoft permission to?\'  I am paraphrasing but you will get the option to click <i>Yes</i> or <i>No</i>; choose <i>Yes</i>.  If the options are <i>continue</i> or <i>cancel</i>, choose <i>continue</i>.</p>\r\n<p>Once the page opens you will have two main options, <i>Express Install</i> or <i>Custom Install</i>.  Choose <i>Express Install</i>.  At this point you will see a green bar moving across the screen.  This is Windows Update examining the configuration of your computer.  This is probably the only time you ever want a website examining your computer\'s configuration.</p>\r\n<p>When the results of this search appear you should choose the <i>Install</i> button on the right hand side of the page. You can rest assured that this method is installing all of the most important and sritical updates that Microsoft has released for your version of Windows</p>\r\n<p>Do whatever Windows Update instructs you to do.  Be patient.  Read the instructions and messages it gives you.  This is not difficult. You may have to run this three or four times after restarts to get all of the updates if you have never updated before.</p>\r\n<p>I suggest this be done at least once a week or setting Windows update to <i>Automatically download and install updates</i>.  Setting this is easy and can be done from the <a href=\"www.windowsupdate.com\">Windows Update</a> page.  This will help you from suffering from horrible flesh eating virii.</p>\r\n	\r\n<h3>Get some anti-Spyware software.</h3>\r\n<p>Spyware is software that is installed on your computer without your knowledge.  Spyware is angry software that can perform any wide variety of tasks.  Spyware can collect what you type.  Spyware can collect passwords.  Spyware can collect your credit card information, your social security number or worse the addresses of naughty sites you might visit.  I\'m not telling you this so you leave the internet and never come back.  It\'s important to know about this so you can protect yourself.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html\">Spybot</a> is an excellent <strong>free</strong> anti-Spyware program.  Download this program and run the installation.  Very straight forward and easy to use.  When you run Spybot, you will need to use the <i>search and destroy</i> feature. It will help you eliminate both spyware and, our next enemy,	adware.</p>\r\n\r\n	\r\n<h3>Adware.  The most annoying part of the internet.</h3>\r\n<p>Spam is irritating.  The only thing more annoying than spam though is pop-up advertisements.  There are several solutions to this plague upon your house.  Half of your pop-ups are probably caused by programs called adware which have been installed on your computer in a method similar to  the way Spyware is installed.  The differences are important though.  Adware\'s only objective is to annoy you with its advertisements.  <a href=\"http://www.lavasoftusa.com/\">Download Ad-Aware</a>.  This is a program which finds the adware programs in your computer and removes them.  It also serves as anti-spyware. This program is very easy to use and self explainatory.</p>\r\n<p>The other half of your pop-up problem is surely provided by the pages you visit.  If you insist on using Internet Explorer, install the <a href=\"http://toolbar.google.com/\">Google Toolbar</a>. It has a built in pop-up blocker and really helps fight this problem. Although if you take my next piece of advice you won\'t need a search toolbar or a pop-up blocker because thats all integrated into <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/\">Firefox</a>.</p>\r\n	\r\n<h3>The browser is the proof in the pudding.</h3>\r\n<p>A significant portion of the problems that I have heard about on computer has to do with the browser that you are using.  If you are using Internet Explorer you are opening yourself to vulnerabilities.  <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/\">Download Firefox</a>.  Use Firefox. Never deal with these issues again.</p>\r\n<p>I switched to Firefox about eight months ago and haven\'t looked back since.  I have not had the same problems I had prior to using Firefox and the only explaination is that Firefox is omnipotent. I could tell you about all the wonderful features of Firefox and all the reasons why you should switch but <a href=\"http://browsehappy.com/\">it\'s already been written</a>. You should read up and then switch.  It will save you alot of grief.</p>\r\n<p>If you are using Outlook or Outlook Express for your email you should switch to <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/\">Thunderbird</a>.  It\'s Firefox\'s sister email program.  Again you wont regret it. <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/why/\">Read why you should switch to Thunderbird</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The last bits... virus protection</h3>\r\n<p>I start by saying, \"I have never had anti-virus software and I have never had a virus.\"  <del>Screen goes blank and Tim screams... KHAAAAAAAN!!!</del> You may want to look into a virus scanning software.  My father uses <a href=\"http://www.symantec.com/index.htm\">Norton Anti-Virus</a>.  The College uses <a href=\"http://www.mcafee.com/us/default.asp\">McAfee VirusScan</a>.  My father has never steered me wrong but he	doesn\'t have the technical saavy of an entire IT team.  You be the judge.  Like I said I have never used one but I think they are important.</p>\r\n<p>If you are lookinf for something of the <strong>free</strong> nature you can download the <a href=\"http://free.grisoft.com/freeweb.php/doc/1/\">AVG Anti-Virus program</a>. Not only do they provide free virus protection software but they also ofer free updates.</p> \r\n	\r\n<h2>So what\'s the bottom line?</h2>\r\n<p>So the bottom line is that if you do all of the things I have written about you may still get a bowel wrenching computer virus.  You may still have to deal with pop-ups and you may still risk getting hacked.  The chance is always there but these will significantly decrease those chances.</p>\r\n<p>When you are surfing the internet <strong>use common sense</strong>.  If something seems to be shady, it probably is.  Don\'t download files from websites you aren\'t familiar with.  Don\'t accept email from strange email addresses (my email address used to be mulefritters@yahoo.com, that\'s	sort of strange).  Don\'t download attachments from people you don\'t know.  Read the error messages that appear.  Don\'t just click <i>okay</i> or <i>cancel</i> assuming that you are answering the right question.  It\'s better to read a pop-up and answer a question correctly than to assume and end up with a piece of software on your computer that you don\'t want.  You may not know exactly what they mean but usually if you give it that good old college try and use your intuition you will be able to tell whether it\'s good or bad.  Good Luck and happy browsing.</p>\r\n<p>This checklist is inspired by Jason Kottke.

	(97,1,'2004-01-14 00:00:46','2004-01-14 05:00:46','We came back from Venice 2 weeks ago. Being the bum that I am I haven\'t posting anything about the trip. So here\'s a bit of a story. New Years Eve was possibly the most exciting part so I\'ll start there.\r\n\r\nTrish and I had just finished dinner and we walked to the Piazza di San Marco. It\'s a square at the heart of Venice that\'s about the size of a football field. Three sides are surrounded by archways with columns on each side. On the fourth side there is the Basilica di San Marco and a bell tower which is about twice the size of the basilica. We figured that if there was going to be a Penn\'s landing style celebration somewhere in Venice, this would be the place.\r\n\r\nI ventured toward some polizia (police) to see if I could get the low down on what would happen there that night.\r\n\r\n\"Parlo Inglesay,\" I say. You\'ll have to forgive the spelling of my Italian. I don\'t speak it, so I sure in the hell can\'t spell it.\r\n\r\n\"A little\"\r\n\r\n\"Sweet. What happens here at midnight,\" I say. I figured if anyone knew the police would know.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" replies the officer with a smirk.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, you night as well go home.\"\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/timmyfury/8469373/\" title=\"Photo Sharing\" style=\"float:right;padding:5px 0 5px 5px;\"><img src=\"http://photos8.flickr.com/8469373_24926c935a_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" alt=\"Toilette\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\nI was so confused. I wasn\"t sure if he was screwing with me or if the wine was playing tricks on my head. \"What do you mean by nothing?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean nothing. No people, no fireworks, nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh sweet, so there\'s fireworks!\"\r\n\r\nAnother officer joined in on the conversation. \"I believe he said nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there anything going on in all of Venice?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing.\" Again with nothing.\r\n\r\nThe other officer chimed in again, \"Perhaps some private party now and then but otherwise, everyone in Venice is in bed by 10.\" A little English, eh? Enough English to fuck with me I suppose.\r\n\r\n\"So there\'s nothing,\" I figured I would give it one more shot.\r\n\r\n\"After 1am there is nothing.\"\r\n\r\nAt this point Trish says to me, \"Cops are the same no matter where you go. They\'re just messing with you.\" So I thank them for there time and we walk away not sure what the hell is going to happen.\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/timmyfury/8470283/\" title=\"Photo Sharing\" style=\"float:left;padding:5px 10px 5px 0;\"><img src=\"http://photos8.flickr.com/8470283_0aa53c2ca4_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" alt=\"Back streets of Murano\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\nThank god Trish was there cause I would have left. I thought they were dead serious. So we walk around a bit longer and get a cup of coffee and eventually I buy a bottle of champagne for later that evening. About 10 o\'clock rolls around and we find ourselves a step in the square to sit down. Fifty feet or so from us there is a group of what I thought were about 15 year olds drinking wine straight from the bottle and setting off small time fireworks. Sparklers, spinners and the occasional pathetic bottle rockets. Nothing big. What was interesting though is that the police were standing right there and they didn\'t say a word to them.\r\n\r\n10:15 a middle aged German couple sits down on the other side of our arch they break open a bottle of red wine and start drinking. Trish and I are doing our slappy act and they are laughing at what we say. So I take a chance and low, they speak English, better then me might I say.\r\n\r\nI pop open the champagne and Trish tastes it. \"It\'s poison,\" she says. So who gets to drink the entire bottle himself.\r\n\r\n11:15 rolls through and I am finished the bottle of champagne. I get up to throw out the bottle and bum a cigarette and by the time I am back there is a South African family sitting to Trish\'s right and an English couple to her left. Both spoke English which was convenient cause after a bottle of wine at dinner and a bottle of champagne in the square, I\'m surprised I still could.\r\n\r\nThe Englishmen, the South African father and myself proceeded to rip on each other\'s governments for the next 45 minutes. All good natured of course.\r\n\r\n11:30 there are about 2000 people in the square. They are walking through the square lighting m-80\'s and dropping them on the ground. Zero regard for anyone standing there.\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/timmyfury/8470886/\" title=\"Photo Sharing\" style=\"float:right;padding:5px 0 5px 5px;\"><img src=\"http://photos7.flickr.com/8470886_2ec343a7fd_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" alt=\"Distant pigeons\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n11:45, now there are about 3500 people. Three circles have formed and people are throwing fireworks from the crowd into the center of the circle. Trish and I are amazed by this all because the police are still standing right there.\r\n\r\nAt midnight the crowd started whoopin\' and hoppin\'. One of the circles has been absorbed and the remaining two have grown to about 100 feet across. Now they are setting off fireworks. Not fire crackers. Full on Fireworks. I mean like the Penn\'s Landing kind. I mean the 150,000 dollar display kind. I mean the $200 at South of the Border kind. I mean the \"night in jail just for having them\" kind.\r\n\r\nThe really loud ones that they usually launch really high up and they still wrack your body when they explode. They were just lighting them and throwing them into the middle of the circles. They are launching the full size starburst fireworks, you know the really colorful big ones, right from the edges of the circle. They were exploding literally 100 feet over our heads.

I couldn\'t figure out for the life of me what it was.  It\'s not the first time I had run into this problem and I knew the root of it was in the fact that that some of the content is copied from Microsoft Word and pasted directly into ZOPE (our CMS) and saved to the site.  The fact that this suddenly started happening had me even more confused. </p>\r\n<p>Last night I was reading <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321303474/mezzoblue-20/102-1829308-9192157\">The Zen of CSS Design</a> and came onto the bit about character sets and it clicked.  A few weeks ago I was checking how the site did in a validation.  This is very close to impossible based on the size of the site and the number of people who are maintaining content.  I do the best I can and check every now and then.  Well at some point I lost the charset information in the meta data of the site.  I wen to veryraw and copied the charset information and pasted it into the header of dccc.edu.  Here is where the problem began.</p>\r\n<p>This site uses <code>text/html; charset=utf-8</code>,  dccc.edu uses <code>text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1</code>.  The differences are not all that extreme.  Though utf-8 does not accomodate curly quotes, em dashes or curly apostrophes.  Ideally we should be using HTML entities for these anyway.  Changed the charset and the problem is solved.</p>\r\n<p>Moral of the story is \'If you have alot of people copying from Microsoft word onto the web, use charset ISO-8859-1\'.

I\'ll give a quick rundown for the layman.  Any <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chmod\">further explaination</a> is on you.\r\n\r\nLinux is an operating system based on unix.  chmod is a shell command for the unix-like environment. It is the abbreviation of \"<strong>ch</strong>ange <strong>mod</strong>e.\"  It\'s used to give different users access to different things in the network environment.  This command becomes very useful in web design when you start doing file manipulation and if you don\'t understand it you may lose your mind.\r\n\r\nThere are three user groups, owner, group and world.  These are relatively self explainatory and I am sure you can figure out which each one means.  Then there are three settings which must be taken into consideration when creating security policies.  Read, which give the right to read.  Write, which give the ability to alter the file.  Then there is execute, which as the name implies gives the right to execute the file to a particular user type.\r\n\r\nThe chart ends up like this.\r\n<table cellpadding=\"4\" border=\"1\" title=\"chmod chart\">\r\n<tr>\r\n<th></th>\r\n<th>owner</th>\r\n<th>group</th>\r\n<th>world</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>read</th>\r\n<td>\r\n<div align=\"center\">4</div>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div align=\"center\">4</div>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div align=\"center\">4</div>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>write</th>\r\n<td>\r\n<div align=\"center\">2</div>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div align=\"center\">2</div>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div align=\"center\">2</div>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>execute</th>\r\n<td>\r\n<div align=\"center\">1</div>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div align=\"center\">1</div>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<div align=\"center\">1</div>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\nYou then use binary to figure out the settings. The chart makes it easy. <a href=\"http://www.intuitor.com/counting/\">I use my fingers</a> though. You can check the spots you want rights for and then add the numbers in those columns and voila.  You have your security settings.\r\nYou would run the command by typing in the chmod then the 3 digit security setting. Full rights you would type, \"chmod 777.\" No rights you would type, \"chmod 000\"\r\n\r\nBack to the original, \"I want a pair of boxers that say \'chmod 777\' across the crotch.\" This would give everyone full access to your boxer shorts.\r\n\r\nI saw something intrinsically wrong with this.  When you use chmod on a folder.  Which in my opinion the underwear serves as, you arealso giving the same settings to everything in the underwear.  Therefore if you \"chmod 777\" your underpants, you are not only giving full rights to the pants, but also the cock, the balls and the anus.  This could possibly offer a serious situation.  I mean who knows what who is going to do to the contents of your underwear once they have full rights.\r\n\r\nThis idea obviously has some ver significant security holes in it.  Not a very werll thought out plan.  And we wonder why there are so many security flaws in systems today.\r\n\r\nMy own personal underpants security settings would be \"chmod 444.\"  This would give all the rights to take a peak but none the ability to delete.  Then I would set the contents seperatly.\r\n\r\nMy penis gets a \"chmod 550.\" You would think that I need full rights.  I don\'t.  There are very few time when write permissions are needed.  You don\'t want to end up chopping it off or tattoing it sometime when you are wrecked and stranded in Vegas with four french hookers and a chinamen.  No.  Write privileges can be turned on when they are absolutely needed.  But I have turned them off to avoid serious accidents.  As for giving the group settings a five.  This is a relatively elite group of people.  Girlfriends and doctors really.  They may have equal rights to me.  Everyone else gets nothing.  There will have nothing of strangers executing my penis.\r\n\r\nLast but possibly the most important security setting.  The anus.  I give my anus a \"chmod 100.\" This way I may execute it which is obviously a must, But no one will have the freedom to just read and certainly not write to it any time they please.','Chmod and your underpants',0,'',NULL,NULL,'publish','closed','closed','','chmod-and-your-underpants','','','2006-02-15 09:46:41','2006-02-15 14:46:41','',0,'http://veryraw.com/history/2005/03/chmod-and-your-underpants/',0,'','',0),

The semester was complicated infinitly though by my promotion.  Previously I was Library Technology support.

My skill set has grown significantly and I had been looking for a new job that would utilize these skills.  I had a difficult time finding anything though because I had no official education and the only proof I had that I could do what I said I could do was my personal sites.  And my word... right... personal sites.  I have been given the chance to prove myself.  It\'s probably the best thing (professionally) that could have happened to me.  When I finished <a href=\"http://www.mis.temple.edu/\">my degree at Temple</a> I\'ll also have five years of experience in an academic institution and two years in a development environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only thing that makes it better is that I joined the team at a point just before the first redesign of the site in over a year.  I was able to influence enough to redesign using <a href=\"http://www.webstandards.org/\">web standards</a>.  At the moment there are some hitches we are trying to overcome so the new design isn\'t up.  I didn\'t choose the design, but I am taking the design and marking it up with <acronym title=\"Cascading Style Sheets\">CSS</acronym> and <acronym title=\"eXtensible Hypertext Markup Language\">xHTML</acronym>.

This article, <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/89/creativity.html\">The 6 Myths of Creativity</a>, is interesting though and I think alot of people, from the lowest to the highest, could benefit from the research that Teresa Amabile is doing in creativity research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her first myth, \"Creativity Comes From Creative Types\",  is my favorite.

Pedro Navarro and Karen Rege made it possible for me to manuever my schedule between class and work, allowing me to complete my course work.  Eric Wellington with his constant encouragement and ability to deal with 10,000 requests for substituted courses and overriding of placement tests.  Ann Marie Neary for her encouragement and inspiration when I was a know nothing jackass (When I was?).  And of course the never ending love and encouragement of Trish.  She prodded me to apply to Temple.  She forced me to sign up for classes on time.  She listened to me bitch and moan.  And she comforted me each time I had lost hope or direction.  I certainly couldn\'t have done it without her.</p>\r\n<p>The battle isn\'t over though.  I start at Temple in January.

You\'ll have to bear with me because I am going to try to explain this properly but I\'m not sure how clear I\'ll be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For about a year now I have been looking for a way to manage links.  I spend a significant amount of time surfing, that is just reading random things on the web about stuff that may not pertain to anything in particular.  I want to save it, but how.  It\'s a common problem, I think.  How can I possibly organize my links so that I can find them later.  Furthermore, how am I supposed to access bookmarks at home that I have made at work?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have tried many solutions to this, the most recent of which is extensive link lists on my blog.  This is equally as inefficient because I still have to remember what I wrote about them so I know what to search for when I look for them on my blog.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Enter <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/\">http://del.icio.us/</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It\'s not just a cool looking URL.  It\'s a social bookmarks website. It allows you to bookmark web pages by storing them on your del.icio.us profile page.  Furthermore you can add descriptions and tags.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tags are the most interesting part.  Add as many as you want, they act as categories.  This allows you to keep track of the links the way you want.  In other words the way you think.  This makes finding them easier later.  It also groups them with other links that might be related.  It also shows you how many others have saved it and allows you to see all other links which have been saved using the same tag.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This tagging is known as folksonomy, a term coined by Thomas Vander Wal.  Basically its a taxonomic categorization system without the strict rules.  Its categorization by free association.  This concept has been used in several Internet applications including del.icio.us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have not experimented extensively with this application yet.  I have a few uses for it which I will share at a later date.  Go test del.icio.us out.

What\'s Audioscrobbler you ask?   It\'s a service that creates a profile of your musical taste.  I registered shortly after properly tagging all of my (now 9,641) mp3\'s using <a href=\"http://musicbrainz.org/\">MusicBrainz</a>.  Initially I did it to be able to utilize the iPod which I had then not purchased.  Audioscrobbler was just an added bonus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I recently cracked 7,000 songs on my Audioscrobbler profile.  If you look at the profile you will notice a few things.  By the weekly statistics you will notice that I listen to the same bands over and over again.  I may have alot of music but generally I cycle through a lot of the same stuff.  The most notable thing that you\'ll see though is although I have a pretty varying taste in music, Tom Waits appears to be by far my favorite musician.  I suppose that although I am a whore for a good break beat, I can\'t get enough of this crooner\'s twisted melodies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am recommending to all who read my site and enjoy listening to music as they while away their youth, sign up for this service.  It\'s simple and fun, you can add people as your friends and get music recommendations.  You can create and join groups.  You can be like me, a slut for data and statistics.  I liked it enough I even donated and got the sexy little plus sign next to my name.  Go.  Do it.  And tell me what your profile name is so I can add you as my friend.</p>','Long Live Tom Waits !',0,'',NULL,NULL,'publish','closed','closed','','long-live-tom-waits','','','2005-02-10 22:41:24','2005-02-11 03:41:24','',0,'http://veryraw.com/history/2005/02/long-live-tom-waits/',0,'','',1),

The results of this on my life have been amazing.  Trish has noted many times since how little I bitch about my job now.  The frustration level is so long in my new position that its more of a pleasure than a pain to go to work.  \r\n\r\nOne of the differences between this job and the previous is that I am no longer crawling around on floors.  I\'m either at my desk or meeting with people about projects that we are working on.  There is little physical exertion (outside of lifting my coffee cup).  So I have started to \"dress for success\".  That means shirt and tie - every day. I\'m actually enjoying it too.  I\'ve been buying new stuff pretty consistantly.  To a fault actually, I spend nearly my entire paycheck every two weeks now on shirts and ties and pants and shoes.  \r\n\r\nThe reason I mention this is because I have made one very important observation.  Take this to heart men.  If you are buying ties, you may not think that there is a difference between a $15  and a $60 tie, but there is.  When you tie a $15 tie, it may look alright at first but by the end of the day you have a tight knot at your neck.  Looks alright but not as good as it did when you first put it on.   When you tie a $60 tie, you get a nice meaty knot.  At the end of the day you still have that meaty knot.  The tie looks exactly the same at the end of the day.\r\n\r\nSo don\'t spare expense on your ties.  You can get cheap shoes, pants and shirts if your budget doesn\'t warrant expensive clothes.  You will still look good.  People don\'t notice these things.  People always notice your tie.  If you cheap out on your ties, everyone will know that you cheaped out on your ties.','$60 dollar ties',0,'',NULL,NULL,'publish','closed','closed','','60-dollar-ties','','','2005-02-25 17:01:20','2005-02-25 22:01:20','',0,'http://veryraw.com/history/2005/02/60-dollar-ties/',0,'','',6),

I\'m not so good with the later.  The former I excel at because I\'ve learn that dealing with large groups of children is like dealing with a very large herd of sheep.  You push a few in a general direction and the rest will usually follow.  Then when all else fails if you talk really loudly and make broad gestures, they will try to get away from you.

I noticed every year that I would spend a significant amount of time giving directions to campers to nearly no avail. The problem is this - your average person loses track of what you\'ve told them after about three rights and a left.  Myself, if you try to tell me the steps of a process, my brain takes a break after about five steps.  What would have helped in this endeavor is signs.  Nothing.  The signage in the museum was always dismal at best.  </p>\r\n<blockquote cite=\"http://www.sba.gov/test/wbc/docs/chart_courses/signs.html\">A visible, readable sign, can make the difference between profit and loss for your business. Many businesses attribute a large percentage of their business to their signs.<br /><a href=\"http://www.sba.gov/test/wbc/docs/chart_courses/signs.html\">Small Business Administration - Women\'s Business Center</a></blockquote>\r\n<img src=\"http://veryraw.com/images/medium/tfisignage01.jpg\" style=\"float:right;padding:5px 0 5px 5px;\" /><p>This statement could be applied to the museum\'s environment.  The success of the museum depends on patrons getting to see what they came to see.  After five years working there I know the halls and stairs and elevators in  a coma.  That\'s after five years.  Every stairway and elevator leads to a different section of the building.  Third floor on this elevator takes you to staff only areas.  On that elevator third floor leads to exciting exhibits.  There was never a difference to visitors because nothing was there to notify them.</p>\r\n<p>That all changed this year.</p>\r\n<p>The signs started appearing slowly in the beginning of this Camp-in season and over the course of this year have taken over.  I don\'t think that I\'ve been asked for directions once; the signs take care of it. </p>\r\n<p>If you look at the first sign here (from the main elevator), there\'s a different color for each floor.  A trend that continues throughout.  They are basic and clean, simple and clear.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http://veryraw.com/images/large/tfisignage06.jpg\" /></p>\r\n<p>Whats more is they\'re modular.  The sign above is a perfect example of this.  On the third floor Moneyville is on the sign.  Moneyville is a traveling exhibit that will only be at the museum for a little while.  When <a href=\"http://www.bodyworlds.com/en/pages/home.asp\">Body Worlds</a> comes toward the end of the year, they\'ll be able to swap out Moneyville for Body Worlds.  The signs are built from many little signs.  Very ingenious.</p>\r\n<img src=\"http://veryraw.com/images/medium/tfisignage04.jpg\" style=\"float:right;padding:5px 0 10px 5px;\" />\r\n<p>This principle is applied in other places like the observatory.  If it\'s closed they post the closed sign.  If it\'s open, the open sign.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http://veryraw.com/images/large/tfisignage05.jpg\" /></p>\r\n<p>If you\'ve ever given directions at the museum you know that they all involve the Pendulum Staircase.  Boldly labeled.  So important.  These stairs will take you anywhere.  So important to label them.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http://veryraw.com/images/large/tfisignage03.jpg\" /></p>\r\n<p>What I like most about the signs though is the iconography.  Every exhibit or area has its own icon.  They are simple, just white shapes and outlines, but they are descriptive.  I personally have a strong affinity for the sultry Ben Franklin icon used for the memorial.</p>\r\n<p>I asked around and the king\'s gold  goes to Jeanne Maier and Jacey Stroback for this excellent signage.  I haven\'t met either one of these marvelous designers but thought I would mention them and rave.</p>','Signage at the Franklin Institute',0,'',NULL,NULL,'publish','closed','closed','','signage','','','2005-05-05 06:03:01','2005-05-05 11:03:01','',0,'http://veryraw.com/history/2005/02/signage/',0,'','',1),

Have you seen <a href=\"http://www.picasa.com/\">Google\'s Picassa</a>?  Amazing.  It\'s given me control over my image information that I never thought was possible.  Leave it to Google I suppose.  I really think I am just going to give up and turn my life over to Google.  More on this later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have had some time to think about the site though.  I have a ton of ideas for veryraw.  I am not sure how I am going to execute them yet.  I am going to add some new sections and shit.  I found the archives from timmyfury (for those of you who were here last year).  I am going to post that.  I think I am going to put up a section for some illustrations and animations from old.  Little more integration of other services (audioscrobbler, del.icio.us).  More frequent updates.  A portfolio which is slowly becoming something worthwhile. And finally a gallery area.  The galleries will probably be a passworded area.  I have alot of images that I would like to share but its really a controlled area.  Don\'t want the world seeing everything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other major change will be the implementation of wordpress 1.5.  It looks pretty amazing.  I had wrestled with the idea of abandoning wordpress altogether and developing my own blogging software again but there\'s really no ROI on that.  The only reason to do that would be to build on my skills but I don\'t foresee it helping me expand on anything that I am currently focusing.  So I\'ll stick with wordpress.  When I do it the site is gonna be really messed up for a few days.  It\'ll still be functional though.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you hadn\'t noticed I have been playing with the right column.  I have added a running list of 15 links from my del.icio.us profile.  They are really just everything that I want to save.  You\'re getting everything there.  The nerdiest of the nerdy and the best of the best links.  I haven\'t decided how to deal with that yet but I was getting tired of having all those links lying around so there you are. Furthermore, there are alot of links over there.  Mark has complained but I\'m really paying attention to what I actually read and find most interesting and when I switch over to 1.5 I will narrow that a bit.  Again it\'s one of those things that I have been thinking about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So this may, for many of you, be a completely superflous entry.  It was almost more of a gather my thoughts entry.

It\'s good.  It\'s really good.  I had a hard time putting it down.  I don\'t read alot of fiction, but I\'ve taken several things from this book that should be noted.  The first few are strictly on a nerdy, I learned something so it wasn\'t a complete waste, level.  The book goes into great detail about the life of a geisha.  The rituals and the customs.  If you had asked me before I read the book to play word association and you said \"geisha,\" I would have replied, \"prostitute.\"  How wrong I would have been.  Arthur Golden\'s extensive research into the world of geisha is apparent and more than succeeded in destroying any preconceived notions I may have had.  Furthermore, it was a look into a culture that generally remains closed. </p>\r\n<p>The second thing that I took from the book was its look at the everyday life of the Japanese during World War 2.  The fact that the entire people were not gung ho intot he war and that they were forced to be so should be known.  It carries weight now for Americans.  Not all of us like the war we are fighting or the policy we are preaching.  I hope that the rest of the world sees this.  It\'s also poignant now in  Japan, where the Chinese are pissed about the glossing over of war discretions in Japanese textbooks.  <a href=\"http://veryraw.com/history/2005/04/in-history-class/\">I\'m not saying that its okay to ignore those things</a>. What I am saying is that its important that the Chinese (in the textbook example) and the world as a whole (in the US example) realize that the entire country isn\'t neccesarily on the same page.</p>\r\n<h3>The book impacted me further though...</h3>\r\n<p>Sayuri, the main character, goes through several traumatic moments in her life and comes out all the better in the end.  The focus though is that with every change she never gives up. She keeps going.  The way she deals with death and loss and setbacks is stoic.  She lets go of things quickly. This allows her to pick up and go on.\r\n</p><p>\"Memoirs of a Geisha\" emphasizes that change is inevitable.  I feel like the book was enforcing the idea that you have to be able to bounce back.  You have to deal with change, confront it and try not to avoid it, try not to lose yourself in it.</p>\r\n','Memoirs of a Geisha',0,'',NULL,NULL,'publish','closed','closed','','memoirs-of-a-geisha','','','2005-05-05 06:01:25','2005-05-05 11:01:25','',0,'http://veryraw.com/history/2005/04/memoirs-of-a-geisha/',0,'','',2),

There are two letters of minimal importance and then there is this letter from the DMV.  For those of you who know anything about my past, particularly in the vehicular sense, can probably guess that I am at this moment staring at the letter spreading peanut butter in my pants.\r\n\r\nThe envelope is about two inches thick.  I\'m like, \"This can\'t be good.\"\r\n\r\nI open it up and I find this letter from the litterbug hotline. I\'m reading it in complete disbelief for two reasons. First, there\'s a such thing as the <a href=\"http://www.dep.state.pa.us/dep/deputate/airwaste/wm/Litter/Facts/Report.htm\" title=\"The Litterbug Hotline Information Page\">litterbug hotline</a>. And second, who the fuck in their right mind would report me to the <a href=\"http://www.litterbug.org/index.htm\" title=\"the litterbug hotline website\">Litterbug Hotline</a>?\r\n\r\nMy first instinct was to blame one of my friends.  Naturally since just about everyone I know  is a complete jerk, this is not out of the realm of understanding.\r\n\r\nSecond accusation was for my father.  I called him this morning to tell him the story and   he was in the middle of teaching a safety course to a bunch of truckers, whom I might add I could hear chuckling in the background.  Actually, when I first called and said I got a letter from the DMV he said, \"Does the letter say that because of your recent speeding issue in Georgia,  we believe you should get your <acronym title=\"Commercial Drivers Liscense\">CDL</acronym>.\"  This got a good reaction   out of the drivers.\r\n\r\nSo anyway to round the story out and finish up. The reason why the envelope was so thick, was not because of a pack of septa tokens.

The problem with that is that I was burning to test out a few new plugins for it.  Plus I had read a bit about the templating system in 1.5.  The theme system is amazing.  You make a theme and then it becomes transportable.  Pretty wild.  I\'ll be interested to see how it ports to the old versions of wordpress after I try to make a theme based on the old design. If I can get it to work then I can upgrade <a href=\"http://debra.veryraw.com/\">Debbie\'s</a> blog too without being forced to spend any time redesigning her\'s too.\r\n\r\nI was going to spend alot of time on this redesign.

	(89,1,'2005-03-07 19:44:56','2005-03-08 00:44:56','I must admit, when the election was wrapped up I <a href=\"http://veryraw.com/history/2004/11/bush-wins-we-all-lose/\">flamed</a> about how stupid Bush voters were and how the country was going to fail.  I wasn\'t really mad, I was drenched in despair.  I was sad; very sad.\r\n\r\nFour months later the feelings of remorse are gone.  The things that I thought were going to happen haven\'t happened.  The war in Iraq (which was not one of my issues) has, at least for the time being, seemed to spark a near epidemic of Middle Eastern Democracy&trade;.  Nations we never though would embrace the flavor of Middle Eastern Democracy&trade; are jumping on the bandwagon like its full of free Kalishnakofs.  Some oposition groups in these countries have gone as far as to say that Bush\'s invasion of Iraq was the starting point for these reforms - in other words, without them there would be little change.  \r\n\r\nAs for social security, which is the only other big move that Bush has pushed since his inuaguration in January, I don\'t have a problem with what he\'s saying.  There have been minimal specifics but <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4525458\">Bush is touting his plan</a> like a superstar.  There are alot of problems and benefits but to be honest, the important thing is that he gets people talking about it.  With the exception of minor changes and modifications to who and how people can receive their benefits, no president has really touched Social security since its <a href=\"http://www.ssa.gov/history/history.html\">inception</a>.  I really don\'t think that Bush\'s major contribution to Social Security will be reform.  I think it will be rhetoric.\r\n\r\nWhat really bothered me about Bush\'s re-election was less about the next four years and more about the next thirty.  There was alot of talk about the chance for whoever was elected to nominate up to <a href=\"http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/justices/fullcourt.html\">four supreme court justices</a>.  This scared me because the impact of a judge spans a lifetime as opposed to the duration of a term.  Furthermore, they aren\'t elected so they can stay non-partisan&trade;.  \r\n\r\nThe popular interpretation of the system of checks and balances gives the Supreme Court a whole lot more power than the President or Congress.  They rule on the actions of both branches in a direct way and, whether or not its the way its supposed to be, they have final say in what happens in government.  This of course may be an improper interpretation but it is the way I see it and a trend that I have seen in conversations prior to and since the election.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.legalaffairs.org/issues/March-April-2005/review_strauss_marapr05.msp\">Legal Affairs</a> published a piece which corroborated my viewpoint.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>SHOULD THE SUPREME COURT HAVE THE LAST WORD on what the Constitution means? Among the justices, and probably the general population as well, the answer seems obvious: Of course it should. That is what it means to be governed by law. But among constitutional law scholars, one of the hot new ideas is \"popular constitutionalism,\" a theory that \"the people,\" acting through politics, should determine the meaning of the Constitution. According to the popular constitutionalists, either the Supreme Court should get out of the business of interpreting the Constitution or, more combatively, the people should retaliate against the court when it interprets the Constitution in ways with which they disagree.<br /><a href=\"http://www.legalaffairs.org/issues/March-April-2005/review_strauss_marapr05.msp\">Legal Affairs: Pop Con</a></blockquote>\r\n\r\nThis is a point that I have never thought and puts me a little more at ease.  The idea that after a law or action is shot down by the courts, it could be brought back to life in another way by the other branches is wonderful.  It gives some mortality to the decisions of the courts and puts less power in their hands. Perhaps this fact will help keep the Supreme Court impartial&trade; and non-partisan&trade;.\r\n','I was a Bush Nay-sayer.',0,'',NULL,NULL,'publish','closed','closed','','judicial-supremecy','','','2006-04-14 11:33:27','2006-04-14 16:33:27','',0,'http://veryraw.com/history/2005/03/judicial-supremecy/',0,'','',4),

I\'m kind of glad I was though because I wouldn\'t have learned much anyway. I was talking to my nephew yesterday when he found a coin that Trish had brought back from <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/sunflowerseed/sets/246823/\">South Korea</a> a few weeks ago. The information that he\'s missing about the History of the world astounds me.</p>\r\n<p>In school textbooks the history of the United States looks like this...</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Christopher Columbus discovers North America</li>\r\n<li>Pilgrims land on Plymouth rock and befriend the Indians there.  The Indians love their new friends.</li>\r\n<li>Ben Franklin and George Washington lead the colonies to victory in the Revolutionary war against the Bristish</li>\r\n<li>Civil War</li>\r\n<li>Abraham Lincoln Dies</li>\r\n<li>Great Depression</li>\r\n<li>World Wars</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Thats it for the History of the United States.  Nothing else significant happened in over 500 years of history.</p>\r\n<p>I bring this up because I have been watching alot of <a href=\"http://www.historychannel.com/\">History Channel</a> lately.  Two shows in particular have been of particular interest.  \"<a href=\"http://www.historychannel.com/conquest/\">Conquest of America</a>\" and \"<a href=\"http://www.historychannel.com/global/listings/series_showcase.jsp?EGrpType=Series&Id=14304702&NetwCode=THC\">The Conquerors</a>.\"  These shows have really brought to my attention how many holes there are in my knowledge of US history. Now if I can say this with out sounding arrogant I\'ll be surprised. If someone as intelligent as I am can be so amiss of information than what is the state of things in the average uninquisitive American\'s brain?</p>\r\n<p>While I was watching \"The Conquerors\" last night I saw a parallel between the Conquest of Florida and our present day conquest of Iraq.  There are historical similarities where the White house tells the people and the world one thing when they have a completely seperate agenda at hand.  Perhaps if more of America knew about the past, they would have made better choices in the polls last November, or at least they would be as smart as Europeans are to question what is going on in the government.</p>\r\n<p>I get the feeling that the lack of real history education in American schools is not exactly unintentional.  Although this could be another one of my <a href=\"http://veryraw.com/history/2005/03/efile-for-free/\">conspiracy theories</a>.  This same sort of thing is causing trouble in China right now over the Japanese leaving their past out of textbooks. I think that when you leave a bunch of stuff out and people question their own government a little less and the somewhat unsavory activities of a government are ignored. </p>\r\n<blockquote>Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.<br /><a href=\"http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/George_Santayana\">George Santayana</a></blockquote>','Shouldn\'t they teach me that in History class?',0,'',NULL,NULL,'publish','closed','closed','','in-history-class','','','2005-04-21 21:51:05','2005-04-22 02:51:05','',0,'http://veryraw.com/history/2005/04/shouldnt-they-teach-me-that-in-history-class/',0,'','',4),

I\'ve been working on the output of wordpress for a while.  Although I could have just downloaded a theme and skinned it, I decided not to.  I went from the ground up and built exactly what I wanted.  After mangling my site in attempts to be obnoxious after yet another insult for big fonts I thought it was time to finish off the work I\'d done and make veryraw look a bit cleaner and a little more professional. </p>\r\n<p>Although the site is best viewed in something larger than 1024x768, viewers of lesser resolution won\'t lose the content.  The left column is fixed width, but the right is not.  The right column will stretch to the edge of the browser window, and all the additional content in the right column will float to take up as much of the space as possible.</p>\r\n<p>There are a few other additions to the site that I am particularly excited about.  On the homepage, the top of the right column will be occupied by quick thoughts.  These are entries about links or ideas or news that don\'t warrant full out articles, but I still want to note.  I think I shyed away from posting these in the past because they took up so much real estate on the homepage.  So the hope is to increase posting by assigning these to a special area.</p>\r\n<p>The second biggest change is in the navigation of the site.  Across the top there are several links to external sites.  Some of these will eventually become content on veryraw.  I wanted to get the template up and running before I developed that content, but some of those links will change.  Furthermore, the floating bottom content in the right column is different depending on what page you are visiting.  In archives you get different lists than if you are reading an article.  The biggest benefit to all this is that I can target the content here to be as helpful as possible for the current content, rather than viewing the same additional content all the time.  Of note are the \"Similar entries\" column on the single article page, and the \"favorite entries\" in the archives area and on my 404 page.</p>\r\n<p>The <acronym title=\"Cascading Style Sheets\">CSS</acronym> was rough but it came together.  There are some details still to address which I couldn\'t address without the real content.  I have tons of stuff that I can add now that I have the flexible additional content areas.

I searched for names they would have called me.  You know... derivatives of my name, not the names I am generally called on a regular basis (some too nasty to mention here).  \"Tim Crowe\", \"Timmy Crowe\"... nothing.  \"Timothy Crowe\"? Nothing? What?

Of course the nature of my profession gave me a higher standing in the results.  I came up all over the place.  Postings on forums, my professional page at the college, and a few of the other sites that I have profiles at.  This had caused some confusion in the past.  I have recieved emails from people looking for Timothy Crowe the criminologist.  Enough that I have a pre-formed email to send in response to help these poor souls find the proper Timothy Crowe.\r\n\r\nNow its like google doesn\'t even know me.  There are all these other Timothy Crowe\'s out there.  I\'m scared.

The dual disc.  A dual disc is a double sided disc that features the  music on one side and video features on the other.   The idea is that by offering additional content on the second side of the disc, people won\'t download the music rather than buy it.  The biggest benefit they think is that the discs use existing technology and the consumer will not need to buy anything to use them. </p>\r\n<p>There are two major drawbacks I see with this technology.  First of all the discs are thicker than a normal cd making it difficult for older cd player to read.  The second one is that the \"additional features\" that the music industry is offering are completely worthless to most consumers.  Personally I buy a cd for music.  I don\'t want video of my favorite band.  How many times can you possibly watch a video of a band?  How much value does this really add.  More over, the discs are more expensive which makes me want to buy them less.  </p>\r\n<p>They are basing their concept on that of the movie industry\'s bonus features concept for DVD\'s.  Bonus features on DVD\'s are lame.  I don\'t buy DVD\'s for bonus features.  In fact I avoid them at all costs.  If I have a choice between \"Maximum Overdrive\" and \"Maximum Overdrive: ultra-platinum super sweaty Emilio Estevez edition with 2 more hours of hot gas pumping action and outtakes\" I\'m not sporting the extra 10 bucks to see that hot piece of meat fill more trucks with gas.  I buy a DVD for the movie.  I buy a CD for the music.  All that extra crap is in the way.</p>\r\n<p>The worst thing about it is that some artists are embracing the idea of the dual disc.  Bruce Springsteen\'s newest album is being released exclusively on dual disc.  I\'d like to know if Bruce has really thinks that his aging fan base is going to embrace it along with him.  Besides that fact, what makes Bruce think that he\'s good enough to even try something new like this.  I would expect that this will hurt his sales.   I suppose we will have to wait and see.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://politics.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/04/21/2058212&from=rss\">In other news, big business is trying to take ownership of more information</a>.</p>','Walmart sales figures at DVD players remain the same.',0,'',NULL,NULL,'publish','closed','closed','','walmart-sales-figures-at-dvd-players-remain-the-same','','','2005-04-25 12:11:24','2005-04-25 17:11:24','',0,'http://veryraw.com/history/2005/04/walmart-sales-figures-at-dvd-players-remain-the-same/',0,'','',3),

The actual aesthetic was designed by an outside consultant.  The purpose of the redesign was to make the site more closely match the printed marketing propaganda that the college gives out.  Its branding, nothing new and I\'m not sure why it hadn\'t been done before. </p>\r\n<p>For Michael and I though the redesign offered us a chance to clean up alot of things that had been irking us for a while.  Here\'s a list of the goals that we made valient efforts to accomplish in this redesign, then I\'ll get to the point of the entry.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Eliminate the javascript dropdown menus and replace them with a leaner, meaner web standards based menus.</li>\r\n<li>Simplify the logic in the template helping the page load faster by eliminating steps.</li>\r\n<li>Minimize the page size of the page by cutting images and bloated javascript files.</li>\r\n<li>Recode the site with xhtml and css to make it 508 compliant.</li>\r\n<li>Remove some static html pages and replace them with dynamic database driven pages managed by administrative modules.</li>\r\n<li>Unify identical information in multiple areas to draw from a single source creating more consistent content.</li>\r\n<li>Pay greater attention to semantics in markup by using tags for what they are intended (tables for tabular data, headers for headers, lists for lists) to improve access, searchability and indexing.</li> \r\n</ul>\r\n<p>So thats the short list.  In preparation, we changed about a thousand small things along with spreading content control across the college allowing everyone to maintain their own content. All in all, we cut the load size from nearly 1 meg to around 70k.  A sizable difference.</p>\r\n<h3>Get to the freaking point!</h3>\r\n<p>The graphic design consultant that designed the new site gave us a layered photoshop file with the artsy part of the site.  They failed to address things like links and headers and images.  I was given nearly full freedom to come up with these myself.  After careful consideration I chose the visual styles for the varying elements of the page that you see now. In addition, they didn\'t address the fact that a dark blue background makes for nearly unreadable copy.  This is what led to the severe difference in the appearance of the homepage and the subsequent interior pages.</p>\r\n<h3>Enter the criticism</h3>\r\n<p>Before telling you what our number one criticism was, I will say that even those who gave us this feedback did like the site overall.  The largest majority of the criticism was that the fonts were too large.  The headers of each page in particular.  The copy on the pages is 16 pixels.  Sixth level headers are also 16 pixels although bold.  From there the size climbs 4 pixels each level up.  This puts the second level headers (the pages headlines) at 32 pixels (a far cry from the 50 pixel font I use on veryraw).  My reasoning for selecting such large fonts is rooted in the fact that our institution markets itself to a widely varied age group.  Our 70 year old students may not be able to read the 8 point font that our 18 year old students can. </p>\r\n<p>I received an equal amount of i-can-finally-read-the-sites\'s as I did big-fonts-look-bad.  If I need to choose a camp to appeal to, I will pick the one that benefits based on greater functionality and usability rather than the one that losses based on a matter of personal preference.</p>\r\n<p>For more information on why you shouldn\'t use painfully small fonts, visit the <a href=\"http://usability.gov/guidelines/fonts.html\">US Department for Health and Human Services</a>.</p>\r\n<p>To sum it all up, small fonts suck.  I won\'t try to claim that this is the perfect design.  It\'s far from it.  There are at least 10 problems with the style that I can list off the top of my head which make the site difficult to use.  None of them is the size of the fonts.</p>','Eight point fonts are for losers!',0,'',NULL,NULL,'publish','closed','closed','','8-point-fonts-are-for-losers','','','2005-04-01 15:03:21','2005-04-01 20:03:21','',0,'http://veryraw.com/history/2005/04/8-point-fonts-are-for-losers/',0,'','',2),

Dynamic Stabilization works in much the same way your own sense of balance does. Where you have an inner ear, eyes, muscles, and a brain to keep you balanced, the Segway HT has solid-state gyroscopes, tilt sensors, high-speed microprocessors, and powerful electric motors performing to keep it balanced. Working in concert, these extensively tested, redundant systems sense your center of gravity, instantaneously assess the information, and make minute adjustments one hundred times a second. Segway HT balances whether you\'re traveling at 10 mph, carrying a heavy load, slowly maneuvering in tight spaces, or standing perfectly still.</p>\r\n<p>Move forward. Go forward.</p>\r\n<p>The Segway HT intuitively balances the way humans do - moving forward and backward, responding to changes in your body\'s position. There is no accelerator and no brakes. Lean forward and you move forward. Straighten up and you stop. Lean back, and you move back. To turn, rotate the steering grip under your wrist in either direction. Operation is natural, intuitive, and one of the primary reasons Segway HT so seamlessly integrates into enterprise situations, pedestrian environments, and everyday life.</p>\r\n<p><em>source:</em> <a href=\"http://origin.www.segway.com/segway/introduction.html\">Segway | Introduction to Segway HT</a></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>It was the most fun I have had since I learned how to do spin outs on my Knight Rider <a href=\"http://bigwheelrally.home.att.net/obw/originalbigwheel-pg.htm\">big wheel</a> or donuts in my rear wheel drive eight cylinder.

After about two years, i got really burned out, mostly because there\'s only so much that I can do with the blog idea.  There are only so many things you can add.  In addition, I ended up spending all of my time on that and not as much on things that I really wanted to.  This is when and partially why I switched to wordpress.</p> \r\n<p>In the working world, you are constantly faced with the decision to build or buy.  There are alot of things to take into consideration when you are mulling over this decision (time, money, resources, urgency).  More often than not, unless you are working for a development firm or at a place with an extensive development team there is a good chance you are going to end up making the decision to buy.  If not for the reasons listed above, simply because you can purchase support and upgrades and increased functionality are added for you with little time.  Plus there is likely going to be a large community already using the software.  In other words, why reinvent the wheel?</p>\r\n<p>We have been discussing build or buy alot in my information systems class and we run into this issue at <a href=\"http://dccc.edu\">the college</a> alot.  Not only do we maintain the main website but we have also started to get involved in other business functions of the school.  We are at the beginning stages but there have already been several times when we needed to make the decision to build a system or buy a system.  It\'s about 50% build and 50% buy.</p>\r\n<p>My point here is this, the chances that you are going to buy software rather than build it is significant.  The ability to examine a system, figure out how it works, is a very important skill.  Anyone can build their own application from scratch.  Most people can even build a good application from scratch.  But when you walk into a place and you have to sit down at another person\'s code, the better you are at figuring out what is going on, the more valuable you will be. I\'m not saying its fun, I\'m just saying its a necessary skill.</p>','Build or buy?',0,'',NULL,NULL,'publish','closed','closed','','writing-your-own-cms','','','2005-04-19 22:41:14','2005-04-20 03:41:14','',0,'http://veryraw.com/history/2005/04/writing-your-own-cms/',0,'','',0),

Not only that but my listing for veryraw had completely been removed.</p>\r\n<p>So after realizing that 43things was less about keeping track of goals and more about keeping track of failures, I deleted my account.  One week later I had returned to the top of the google rankings for Timothy Crowe.  It just goes to show the power of a site like 43things.  The entire site is made of of interlinking pages.  When google hit it, it found a way to get to my profile on thousands of pages.  Causing 43things to reference my name an immense amount of times and take over my spot.</p>\r\n<h3>Why does this matter</h3>\r\n<p>As I\'ve said before, the internet is what a good portion of my life is based on.   My income depends on it.  Someday I will go out looking for a new job and they will want to know what I\'ve done.  It would be great to be able to google my name and have my own site come up.

I couldn\'t get over it. \"Thats too much,\" I say. So after about a week of babbling endlessly about how I couldn\'t get over how much 28 pounds of bananas was, I decided to take the scientific approach. So follow with me now.

The prices of these bananas 28 cents, 24 cents, 26 cents, 29 cents and 24 cents. For an average of 26.2 cents per banana</li>\r\n<li>Therefore I conclude that one banana is approxiamately a third of a pound.  (79 cents divided by 3 bananas equals 26.3333 cents per banana.)</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>the findings</strong></p>\r\n<p>My findings were surprising. At 3 bananas per pound, you would only have to eat 84 bananas in one year.  Thats only 1 banana every 4.34 days or 1.6 bananas per week.  Thats only 7 bananas per month.  Thats amazing.</p>\r\n<p>In fact, if you are a 1 banana a day person, in other words you eat 365 bananas per year, you don\'t consume 28 pounds of bananas per year.

I killed so many women; I have a hard time keeping them straight.\"  This is Gary Leon Ridgeway, the Green River Killer.  Fucking amazing.  He looks like a fucking psycho.

I\'m not saying that I think abortion is right, I\'m just saying that you should have the choice of whether or not to ruin your life.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, When Bush signed the bill the other day, his statement was, \"For years, a terrible form of violence has been directed against children who are inches from birth while the law looked the other way, today at last the American people and our government have confronted the violence and come to the defense of the innocent child\"; This right to life cannot be granted or denied by government, because it does not come from government -- it comes from the creator of life.\"  You fucking oil sniffing terrorist.

I don&#8217;t know about you, but I associate different types of music with different weather conditions. I noticed this particularly the other day when driving along listening to my <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ipod/\"  title=\"Apple digital music player\">iPod</a> in the car. It was a really bright sunny morning, and each song selected by the iPod&#8217;s shuffle-play seemed to fit perfectly. Chirpy, upbeat music for a chirpy, upbeat morning.</p>\r\n<p>This got me thinking &#8211; if I could categorise each song in my music collection with a weather type, all iTunes would need to do is grab a local weather feed in XML from <a href=\"http://www.weather.com/\">weather.com</a> (just like <a href=\"http://www.1976design.com/blog/\"  title=\"1976design.com\">Dunstan</a> does) &#8211; and a customised playlist could be constructed to match the conditions outside.</p>\r\n<p><em>source: <a href=\"http://www.allinthehead.com/retro/208/take-the-weather-with-you\">Take the Weather With You</a></em></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Although I find the concept interesting I don\'t know if I would use this.  I mean its interesting and it certainly presents a challenge from a strictly programmatic point of view but I had another idea which I have thought about for a while. I think adding catagories based on <strong>mood</strong> would be a more appropriate way of going about catagorizing music.  Then when you pick up your iPod or sit down at your computer, you could just pick a mood and the computer would assemble a playlist for you.  Songs could fall into multiple mood categories.Would save alot of time and avoid you the annoyance of assembling a playlist everytime you sit down.  The problem of course is, as Drew mentions, categorizing 40gig of mp3 is a torture which no man should ever endure.</p>\r\n<p>For a long time I have been thinking about how to approach this task.  In the hayday of download, when the cup of <a href=\"http://www.napster.com/\">Napster</a> runneth over and <a href=\"http://www.audiogalaxy.com/\">Audio Galaxy</a> was as extensive as the Milky Way, I used to scrap all of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata\">metadata</a> attached to the songs which I downloaded.  Had I just tagged these songs properly when I downloaded them I may not be in the situation I am now.  Many gigs later I finally found the program to accomplish this goal.</p>\r\n<p>Call me <a href=\"http://www.pantheon.org/articles/s/sisyphus.html\">Sisyphus</a>.  I have been working now for almost two months.

It was covered enough that it wasn\'t blinding but I could still see it pretty clearly when I looked at it. In the bottom right side of the sun <a href=\"http://analyzer.depaul.edu/paperplate/Transit%20of%20Venus/sohomdi.jpg\">there was a black dot</a> that was just about to disappear from the face of the sun. Later I was reading the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/googleblog/2004/06/oodles-of-doodles.html\">Google blog</a> (which on a completely separate note I feel they should be calling &quot;The Bloogle&quot;) from the guy who does all the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/holidaylogos.html\">holiday Google logo\'s</a>. There was a logo where one of the o\'s was replaced with a sun with a black dot in front of it similar to the way I had seen the sun earlier in the morning. </p>\r\n<p>Based on <a href=\"http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/transit/venus/city04-2.html\">this time table</a> in comparison to where I was when I saw what I thought I saw, it turns out that I saw the <a href=\"http://www.transitofvenus.org/\">transit of Venus</a>. The phenomenon only happens once every 122 years or so and I actually got to see it. The transit of Venus is almost like an eclipse. <a href=\"http://www.transitofvenus.org/faq.htm#what\">It happens when</a> Venus moves across the disk of the sun showing a black dot in front of the sun.

You can follow what it finds on the <a href=\"http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/home/index.cfm\">Cassini-Huygens</a> page.

It irritated me to think that someone so enthralled with all things binary would say that digital was inferior to old school and shall I say out of date. <a href=\"http://www.timmyfury.com/history/venusandsaturn/#comment261\">He recently commented</a> on my <a href=\"http://www.timmyfury.com/history/venusandsaturn/\">last entry about Saturn</a> that its a shame they aren\'t using real film for the images of Saturn (which I should note I have been more than dissapointed with so far). Never-the less, film would be impossible to use because NASA will no doubt end up losing the Cassini spacecraft in Saturn\'s gassy body. The comment he made when he was here thought which sticks out most in my mind is this. &quot;In ten years, all of your digital images will be thumbnails. I will still be able to enlarge my film.&quot; I hate you so much.</p>\r\n<p>I have recently been agonizing over what insanely priced digital camera to purchase. I am not sure what resolution to go with and what camera has the fastest write time. All together there are about 10 different features which I have decided are most important. All at the same time having an interface as dumb as my first <acronym title=\"Single Lense Reflex\">SLR</acronym> the <a href=\"http://www.vivitar.com/Products/SLRprog/slr.html#V4000-50mm\">Vivitar V4000</a>.

In ten years, all of your digital images will be thumbnails... In ten years, all of your digital images will be thumbnails.&quot; </p>\r\n<p>So the question now is. Do I spend a ton of money on an 8<acronym title=\"megapixel\">MP</acronym> digital or do I spend half the money and get a film camera which does nearly twice as much and has a simple interface?</p>\r\n<p>The answer. Both. I will probably end up buying a new slightly flashier film <acronym title=\"Single Lense Reflex\">SLR</acronym> <strong>and</strong> a fancy high megapixel camera.

Like myself he probably uses the internet for most things.  Most of my friends do.  But with as much information as I have, I also have a very closed word view.  My friends are people who have, use and love technology.  I read the blogs about and by people who have, use and love technology.  I work in an environment which is soaked in, uses and loves technology.  There\'s a big world out there of people who do not embrace it like I or Burn do.  \r\n\r\nRecently I was talking to my very internet savvy sister about flickr.  I was trying to tell her about the benefits of it.  Outside of the whole sharing and viewing other people\'s pictures, what happens to your images when your harddrive blows up.  My god the horror.  If you use flickr you are backed up.  And your information is cataloged and dated and explained.  No dice.  She says, \"I\'d still keep it local too.\"  This is a bit far from the original subject, but my point is that its difficult to get people to change the way they do things.  \r\n\r\nI am certainly not trying to say that Geoff is in the wrong career.  His career choice is no worse than mine.  When I say \"The future is grim for print,\" I am talking in the longterm 80 years from now sense.  When you still hear in the news that the internet is an amazing \"new\" technology, you can be sure that the greatest portion of the country (world) is still on the \"haven\'t touched it\" end of the spectrum.

Basically, while you are reading a website, it secretly clicks every link on the page and downloads all your possibilities ahead of time.

Simple enough concept, the problem is that it teared web applications to shreads.  <a href=\"http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/google_web_accelerator_hey_not_so_fast_an_alert_for_web_app_designers.php\">37 signals reports</a> that it will cick all the links on the site, even the delete links on web applications, ignoring confirmation messages and effectively remove all the data from a web app.  At this point if you have no interest in web development, you may want to check out <a href=\"http://www.monkeywire.org/\">some news about monkeys or something</a>.</p>\r\n<p>So when you are building an application and you want to add a delete link you might make the link something like this...</p>\r\n<code>&lt;a href=&quot;/code/deleting/actions.php?action=delete&amp;entry=17&quot;&gt;delete&lt;/a&gt;</code>\r\n<p>Then when you click the link, it will go to the page which is programmed to delete the entry 17.

The   things that makes me laugh most about this is when I here some retard right   say something to the effect of, \"It destroyed the sanctity of marriage.\"   There is no such thing as sanctity in marriage anymore. People lie and cheat.   Beatings. I was talking to this guy the other day at work and he said, \"Well,   I have to go Wife sit now.\" WHAT? When you start to think of seeing your   wife as a problem, it\'s time to go. There is a huge divorce rate. People split   up at the drop of a hat. Straights have fucked up marriage so badly that half   the time I don\'t even know why people are together. How about the girls that   force marriage on their boyfriends. The guy only talks about it in the first place cause they are afraid of getting cut off. I know a guy who I am convinced only got married so his \"wife\" would have sex with him. What a fucking dummy. Sanctity of marriage my fucking ass. At least homosexuals will add some flair to marriage again. Continue to do things together. Maybe still fuck each other now and then, instead of using sex as a weapon. Instead of getting comfortable with each other, AKA fattening up. An issue like this is why it\'s important   that the Democrats keep Bush from nominating Supreme Court justices. If he gets his far right douchebags on the bench we will suffer severely. Another reason we need to get Bush out of office. To quote <a href=\"http://www.theonion.com/3945/wdyt.html\">The Onion</a>, \"It makes sense for Bush to pull out.

What I was looking at was a mute point. I was looking at this   page and I am fascinated by the concept of a guest book. Of course calling it   this is so old school that it makes me sick.

In his guest book he has all these equally terrible artists who have left him messages about how great he is and how much they like him, the usual cock sucking misogyny. They also all leave links to their pages. So I follow them. The point to my story is this. If you are going   to make a website, make a fucking website. Don\'t make a homepage. No one cares   about you or your favorite links.

I went on a SEO campaign on both <a href=\"http://www.weirdhead.org\">Weirdhead.org</a> and <a href=\"http://www.timmyfury.com\">Timmyfury.com</a> in an attempt to siphon some extra hits from people who do searches for things that might lead them to my page.  This also coincided with my new found addiction to <a href=\"http://www.webstandards.org/\">web standards</a>.</p>\r\n<p>My main source of inspiration, if I should call it that, Was an article on <a href=\"http://www.alistapart.com/articles/seo/\">A list apart</a> and this checklist from <a href=\"http://www.submit-it.com/subopt.htm\">Submit-it</a>.</p>  \r\n<p>Never the less, I am still waiting for some evidence of the benefit of my SEO campaign and its relevance in the area of search. In fact, Weirdhead.org has not benefitted in the least.  This is made apparent in the fact that it doesn\'t even come up on the first three pages when you do a <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=weirdhead\">Google search for weirdhead</a>.  Furthermore, when you search for <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=link:http://www.weirdhead.org\"> backlinks to weirdhead</a> nothing at all comes up and I have certainly linked to it being that it is my other site.  What I find most interesting though is that timmyfury.com appears on the first page, twice, when you do this search.</p>\r\n<p>I have only noticed one difference relating to Google since I went on my campaign.</p> \r\n<p>In the five month period since I started SEO campaign my <a href=\"http://toolbar.google.com/\">google toolbar</a> page rank has gone from a 0/10 to a 4/10.  I was curious as to if these two facts were correlated in anyway.  It turns out that they are not.  In <a href=\"http://www.iprcom.com/papers/pagerank/\">Ian Rogers article about Google page rank</a>, he explains that the page ranking is solely based on back linking.</p>\r\n<blockquote cite=\"http://www.iprcom.com/papers/pagerank/\">\r\n<p>PageRank is one of the methods Google uses to determine a page\'s relevance or importance. It is only one part of the story when it comes to the Google listing, but the other aspects are discussed elsewhere (and are ever changing) and PageRank is interesting enough to deserve a paper of its own.</p>\r\n<p>PageRank is also displayed on the toolbar of your browser if you\'ve installed the Google toolbar (<a href=\"http://toolbar.google.com/\">http://toolbar.google.com/</a>). But the Toolbar PageRank only goes from 0 - 10 and seems to be something like a logarithmic scale:</p>\r\n<table title=\"google page rank\">\r\n<tr><th>Toolbar PageRank(log base 10)</th><th>Real PageRank</th></tr>\r\n<tr><td>0</td><td>0 - 10</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td>1</td><td>100 - 1,000</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td>2</td><td>1,000 - 10,000</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td>3</td><td>10,000 - 100,000</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td>4</td><td>and so on...</td></tr>\r\n</table>\r\n<p><em>source: <a href=\"http://www.iprcom.com/papers/pagerank/\">The Google Pagerank Algorithmand How It Works</a></em></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>It turns out that my Google page rank has more to do with the amount of content on my site then my SEO campaign or my seemingly painful obsession with web standards.  Although Google page rank has only slight bearing on your Google listing overall it does show the importance of frequenting other blog sites like this one and commenting.  Getting your name out there seems to be the best way to improve your Google page rank.  A small site like mine depends mostly on the word of mouth of other small sites in my overall Google listing.</p>\r\n<p>As an aside to this, I noticed that Google itself has a 10/10 google ranking on the Google toolbar. Yahoo and MSN both have 9/10 ratings. I am curious as to why this is. If Google page rankings are based on links, and if as Ian Rogers said the Google page rank is based on backlinks, then since Yahoo and MSN have a far greater amount of countent shouldn\'t they have a higher page rank? I may be jumping to conclusions about MSN and Yahoo having more content, but they seem to. This fact makes me question <a href=\"http://www.google.com/googleblog/2004/05/some-disturbing-results.html\">Googles statements in their blog</a> about not being swayed. <a href=\"http://www.google.com/explanation.html\">They stated that their results are based 100% on their algorithms.</a> I am curious.</p>\r\n<p>Keep in mind that Google was the only search engine I used for my obsrervations; half because I am obsessed with Google and the other half because I am lazy.  Try some searches out.  Let me know what you find. See if any of my most frequently discussed topics come up in Google.</p>\r\n<p><em>I would like to note that my statistics class has come back to bite me in the ass.  I worked pretty hard in the class and got a \"C.\"  Some may say that sucks.  I was so excited because I thought I would fail for sure.  Now I don\'t have to take the course again.  In this entry I linked to some pages that used some statistical concept and terms that I had on many occasions said, \"I will never use this crap.\"  I would like to apologize for these statements.  I used to say the same thing about certain classes in high school and was promptly proved wrong the day I started programming.  I would like to be able to say that I will never make a statement like this again.

Now might I note that I have hated sweatpants for all of   my life but as I have aged slightly now I have found myself cold rather frequently.   In steps sweatpants. Regardless the weird thing about sweatpants is that they   are fuzzy on the inside and they apparently lack the ability to soak up urine. FUCKING URINE!</p>\r\n<p>Next on the adgenda, visual basic.

I am now a manager. It\'s a scary concept.</p>\r\n<p>Timmyfury.com will soon be returning to full functionality. I am working on that now that I have finished up weirdhead.org. Over the course of the next week things will come back on-line. I switched host companies recently because the old company (which shall remain nameless) couldn\'t support some of the things that I wanted to do. So I have switched to <a href=\"http://www.nomonthlyfees.com/\">NoMonthlyFees.com</a>. They are super good and pretty cheap. Furthermore, unlike Dreamhost which I won\'t even grace with a link, they are running a full functioning version of PHP. All of the old content from before I switched hosts is gone though cause I lost the SQL files that had the information in them. So we are starting fresh. If you didn\'t notice at the bottom of each one of my entries now there is a link to make comments about what I write here and you can also read other peoples comments. This is different from the graffiti board and in my opinion way better cause now when you comment on something I write and people read it it will actually make sense.</p>\r\n<p>For all those who don\'t know, Code is in Qatar. This is his third time in the Middle East. He emailed me once then I reset my email account and deleted the email by accident. So I don\'t have it to put up here.

And I ran over this article about <a href=\"http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2004/02/08/agenda_detection.html\">meetings</a> on this guy\'s blog. But I found this entry too on <a href=\"http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2003/07/10/nadd.html\">N.A.D.D.</a> before you read this I would like to give you my rundown. Winamp full of Dead Can Dance, Dreamweaver where I am writing this update, my music library, three   instant messenger conversations, the websites to two of my online classes, my email, and as if it weren\'t enough I also have a two perl manuals open on my   bed and I have my psyche book in my lap from which I am taking a break to write   this. Completely separate from this topic except for the fact that it has to do with slashdot, I hate when people talk about slashdot but they don\'t type it out they just type \" /.\". It\'s fucking queer, stop doing that.</p>\r\n<p>I was sitting at work on Monday and one of my co-workers walks past and asks how I am and I answer what I am supposed to answer, like a good little drone   I tell her I am doing fine. Then I realixze that its Julie and I can tell her how I really am. I mean come on its monday freaking morning. How am I supposed   to be when I have only had 4 cups of coffee. Regardless, I said, \"Actually, I am horribly fine.\" She likes the the connotation of this and responded, \"Well I am excrutiatingly okay with that.\" We went back and forth   for a few moments and came up with a bunch of these. Julie defined them as The   Hyperbole followed by The Mediocre. Give em the grandeur, then give em the expected.</p>\r\n<p>I worked Camp-in again this weekend. It was rather fun. I\'m really into it   this year. I wish I could work more of them. Perhaps a death plot for one of   the other three managers. Hmmmm. um... okay... well it was an interesting evening. It was the night of the <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/mld/dailynews/news/local/7927690.htm\">   incident at the library</a>. This wasn\'t an issue for us although I was worried   early in the night that it may get passed to one of the parents and we would have a bunch of histerical mothers on our hands. There were 600, yes 600, girls   and mothers in the museum on Saturday night. The only 7 guys there were staff.   Damn. Here\'s the poin though. The craziest part of the night was when I was woken up at 4:20 in the morning and the security guard tells me that there is   an alarm clock going off in the store right next to an exhibit that has 77 girls   sleeping in it. It took me a good five minutes to figure out what the hell he   was talking about. I went down to the exhibit and knew right away I was going   to have to call like everyone in the museum at home at 4:30am. This alarm clock   was playing some whack ass disco music and singing and shit. It was crazy. I   ran around the museum for about 30 minutes finding phone numbers and calling   people to try to find a key to the store. No one had one and all the while more and more girls were stirring and my boss was doing all this crazy talk about   moving 77 girls to another place to sleep at 4:30 in the morning. At about 4:45am,   the alarm had been doing its middle-eastern love cry for about 45 minutes now, it just turned off. And thank god cause I do believe that I had about 10 more   minutes before I was forced to walk the plank on the ship in Kid Science.</p>\r\n<p>Idea of the year... I think it is. You know those stickers on bussiness cars   that say, \"How\'s my driving? Call 1-800-PHONE-NUMBER ID-OF-DRIVER\"   okay so I think that I want to get one of those made up but put my cell phone number on it. Then I\'ll go out driving like a complete retard. Someone will   naturally call to report it and I\'ll be like \"What are you a fucking five year old. You fucking taddle-tail!\" then hang up. Or even better I could   be like, \"Describe what he\'s doing.\" Then start driving back and forth   across the road. Drive into oncoming traffic. Wow.

The   fact of the matter is that I have not been able to find any real proof that any of the most recent virus proliferation has anything to do with terrorism   or an attack on the much sought after \"national security.\"</p>\r\n<p>I read <a href=\"http://news.com.com/2100-7349_3-5158496.html\">something very interesting last night</a> which is the root to why I am giving all of you this   information. As you may know Linux is an open-source operating system. It is   free in most cases and there is a strong following in the hacker/web design/server   administration sector of the information technology industry for Linux. It touts   a highly secure environment mostly due to the fact that the source code or the   programming behind how it works is open to everyone, including hackers. This   gives everyone the ability to examine the code and find possible security holes   and exploits. This is a very different approach than our good friends at Microsoft take. Their source code is highly protected. In fact recently about <a href=\"http://news.com.com/2100-7349_3-5158496.html\">1/10th of 1 percent </a>of the code behind Microsoft\'s Windows 2000 professional   was leaked and within a week there were already two highly damaging exploits shared on the internet; in other words two gaping security holes.</p>\r\n<p>  There is a company called SCO which makes server operating system software. They claim that the creators of Linux have stolen a chunk of their code and   they have vowed to sue a large-scale Linux user by today, November18th. Many think this user will be Google. Yes, that\'s right, our long time friend   and ever gracious searching savior. Google is rumored to have somewhere close to 10,000 servers running Linux. </p>\r\n<p>Now here\'s where it gets a little tricky and I\'m not sure if the logic of this and the connection to all of you will come through here.</p>\r\n<p>The myDoom virus was written to attack SCO and Microsoft specifically because of this lawsuit. Microsoft is involved because they want to take Linux out of the operating system game. </p>\r\n<p>Now for the reason that you care. \"And Microsoft, which has been accused of conniving with SCO in its march against Linux, is slated to enter the search   market and compete against Google. The widgetry, which is supposed to retrieve all kinds of file types, both structured and unstructured, and all kinds of   storage systems, beginning with the user\'s own drive, will be integrated into its operating systems like the anticipated Longhorn.\"</p>\r\n<p>This is important and I believe you should all be interested because the ever evil, corporate whoring, monster which is Microsoft could be changing your search in a big way sometime in the near future. In addition, if Microsoft were to include this searching capability in their OS which included searching your personal PC there could be some very serious ramifications. Just imagine if   you had say 7,732 mp3 files on your PC and the RIAA decided to search for them.   Big problem thats a $1,159,800,000 fine you have on your hands there my friend. It\'s enough to make me go Mac or Linux.</p>\r\n<p>Just to wrap it up I think maybe I should point out the point to this rant   because I believe I strayed a bit while I was trying to show you the connection   of this information to us. Viruses are not targeted toward national security. They are targeted toward greedy corporations who try to hinder the development of computing. Secondly, not all hackers  are bad. Some have the security of computing   in mind. And last, Google could be in trouble so keep them in mind in  your bed-time   prayers.</p>\r\n<p>A final thought on the subject from that article on <a href=\"http://www.linuxworld.com/\">LinuxWorld.com</a>, \"Meanwhile, industry wags are saying that God invented SCO to give people a company to hate more than Microsoft.\"</p>','How Microsoft is trying to ruin search',0,'',NULL,NULL,'publish','closed','closed','','how-microsoft-is-trying-to-ruin-search','','','2005-05-13 06:54:04','2005-05-13 11:54:04','',0,'http://veryraw.com/history/2005/05/how-microsoft-is-trying-to-ruin-search/',0,'','',0),
	(180,1,'2004-02-22 00:00:16','2004-02-22 05:00:16','<p>This November we will have an election that pits George Bush against either   John Edwards or John Kerry. Bush currently stands with a <a href=\"http://www.pollingreport.com/BushJob.htm\">48%   job approval rating</a>. In comparisons between Bush and the Democratic prsidential hopefuls Bush stands very close to ebing able to pull an upset and keep the   White House. I think an upset would be if Bush was really low in the polls and   he came back but in this context I am refering to what I will be if Bush wins   this year... UPSET. Regardless, Bush stands within only a few points of Kerry   for the White House in November and Bush and Edwards would be <a href=\"http://www.pollingreport.com/wh04gen.htm\">neck   and neck</a>. All this information aside let\'s take a look at the <a href=\"http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/2000presgeresults.htm\">2000   election</a> for president that brought Bush into power. Al Gore, who regardless   of the fact that he may have very well simply been the lesser of two evils,   lost in both Florida (by less than 600 votes) and New Hampshire (a less dramatic   8000 votes). These are both significant states in the election and had Gore   won either of these states he most likely would have won the election. Our next   observation is that Ralph Nader has similar mores as the Democratic party. Therefore   if he didn\'t want the far right Republican bovine to remain in power you may   think that he wouldn\'t want to take votes from the Democratic candidate in November   like he did in 2000. How many votes did Nader get in Florida and New Hampshire?   97,488 and 22,198 respectively. One might think that with as close as the platforms   that Nader and the Democrats (a really politcally charged name for an anti-Republican   punk band) run on Nader may have decided not to run this November. If this is   what you thought, you would be <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/02/22/elec04.prez.nader/index.html\">wrong</a>.   I think that Kerry and Edwards are gonna have to team up on this one and run   together. </p>\r\n<p>Next on the adgenda is the comment left to me by \"A Person\" on last the <a href=\"http://www.timmyfury.com/history/microsoftruinssearch/\">February 18th</a> update.

It was so fun. Probably one of the most entertaining things   I have seen in a long time. They did the old confetti trick. This is where they   pretend to throw a bucket of water on the audience but its full of confetti. I think one of the funniest things was when they were running down the court   and they threw the ball to the ref. I could be one of the refs on that show.   Mr. Popular, one of the players, came out in the beginning and said, \"before   we get started, we would like to thank our sponsor, Burger King, for allowing   us to eat delicious Whoppers.\" I thought that was funny. </p>\r\n<p>There was this group of High school age kids that performed a dance thing at   half time.

It was a great trip and I still have contact with several of the people that I was on that trip with.  Many of them I see on a regular basis (whether or not it has anything to do with the trip).  Worthless reminiscing aside, there were 36 students on the trip total, 6 of which were guys.  Pretty sweet odds, although I was far too nerdy back then (back then?). When we got to the hotel in Madrid, we were given two rooms for guys.  We split up into two groups of three.  The first group went to their room.  The view was amazing.  You could see the entire city from that room.  So I went over to my room and opened our windows and only found a wall.  The wall you see in the picture next door.</p>\r\n<p>There were four walls and a pit at the center.  In the bottom of the pit was an enormous air conditioning unit.  We were a little bit disparaged, but as they say, \"when the world gives you lemons... you throw them as hard as you can at the air conditioning unit at the bottom of the pit outside of your hotel room.\"  Actually, we threw way more than that down there that week.  Oranges and apples and ashtrays.  Each time they would hit the unit and make a terrible bang and you would here people open the other windows up and down the pit and scream at us in various languages.</p>\r\n<p>The most fun thing that we threw out the window was wads of toilet paper that had been soaked in water.  They hit the wall and explode, then they would peel from the wall and fall to the bottom of the gourge and strike the air conditioner.</p>\r\n<p>There\'s not a man on earth that hasn\'t done this.  Its almost a guarentee if you ask a guy what you do with toilet paper in a junior high bathroom, he\'ll say soak it in water and throw it at a wall.  I mentioned toilet paper to Michael the day i told the Spain story to Trish and the first thing he asked was, \"did you ever soak it in water and throw it against a wall?\"  Try it, it\'s really fun and you\'ll laugh so hard you\'ll be glad you\'re already in the bathroom.</p>\r\n<p>As for the wall in Madrid, I\'d love to go back there one day and see if the air conditioner is stil dented and the toilet paper is still stuck to the wall.</p>','The other great use for toilet paper.',0,'',NULL,NULL,'publish','closed','closed','','the-other-great-use-for-toilet-paper','','','2005-05-21 11:32:01','2005-05-21 16:32:01','',0,'http://veryraw.com/history/2005/05/the-other-great-use-for-toilet-paper/',0,'','',2),

It is widely accepted that a two page PDF can bring a quad-processor 20,000 ghz computer with 4,000,000 megs of RAM and a 256,000 meg video card to its knees in seconds and leave it begging for it\'s Mommy.</p>\r\n<p>I recently installed this firefox extension called <a href=\"http://www.rabotat.org/firefox.html\">PDF Download</a>.  When you are cruising along the internet and you inadvertantly click a link to a PDF, PDF Download prompts you, do you want to open in a new tab, download to the desktop or cancel.  This way you can go on with your day rather than spend the rest of time waiting to regain control of your browser all the while contemplating how awesome Chinese water torture must feel.</p>\r\n<p>All that said, although we have made a very valiant effort to eliminate PDF from the college website altogether, we have been forced to use it in some instances.

I mean imagine if I had suction   cups on my feet. It would obviously rule. You could totally walk up walls and   pick things up without bending over. I mean some people can already do this   but I mean you could do it without being called awful names like \"Crazy Long toe McGee\" or \"Finger Foot\". </p>\r\n<p>Then this made me think back to the good old days. Back when my house was rockin\' an <a href=\"http://members.chello.at/theodor.lauppert/computer/ps2/9556.htm\">IBM   PS/2 486</a>. Man did we rule. We bought this shareware game, called \"<a href=\"http://www.3drealms.com/cosmo/\">Cosmo\'s Cosmic Adventures.</a>\" Circa March 1992. I loved that game. In fact I loved it so much that I still have it. It originally came on one 3.5\" floppy and took like 3 minutes to load. That was on <a href=\"http://www.logicalsky.com/Windows31_FAQ.htm\">windows3.1</a>. Now I have moved up in the world and I have me this fancy pentium2.3ghz with close to a gig of RAM driving around with a full load of software on Windows XP Pro. Only took me three days to install on this machine and close to 25 minutes to get the damn thing running but man is this sweet.</p>\r\n<p>Look at this guy. It would rule. You could drink as much as you want and never drop your glass. You could climb buildings and shit. You would rule the window   washing business. I do suppose there would be downfalls though. There\'s no way in hell you could manage driving without some sort of special apparatus. Changing   your spark plugs may be difficult. Certainly you would have extreme trouble with your girlfriend\'s extra-curriculars. Although I suppose it would make a <a href=\"http://www.cloudforest-mexico.org/183.htm\">serious penis enlargement system</a>. It could also make a great portable cereal bowl. But not at the   same time I suppose.</p>\r\n<p>To sum up what I am trying to say, giant suction cups have benefits and fallbacks just like hands do.</p>\r\n<p>On a completely seperate note, Like two years ago when I did a search for Cosmo there was nothing.

There has been some very much deserved  credibility given to blogs in the news and on TV.  Some very \"famous\" bloggers are making some very good money and receiving notoriety for their opinions and their work.  Problem is that with the fame and fortune of some many others have tried to jump on the wagon.  The effect is that since applications such as Blogger and livejournal have made it so easy to voice your opinion, every seems to think that now their opinion matters.  We all know that this is not true.  Every opinion does not matter.  I\'m not saying that opinions which differ from mine are worthless.  This is not a commentary in the guise of telling you how enormous my ego is.  I\'m saying that opinions which have no backing arguments or opinions which are not thought out are worthless.  People who cannot back up what they say, people who don\'t know what they are talking about, people who give up on their opinion when you offer just a few measley reasons why they are wrong and don\'t try to defend their stance should stop having opinions.  People who cannot accept their opinions being criticized should not display them in a public forum.  (Steps off soap box and continues with entry)</p>\r\n<p>My point is that although every person <em>can</em> have a place to display their thoughts and opinions into the public forum, not every example of this is the same.  I feel that the label \"blog\" is too freely placed on every single person\'s online presence regardless of what content is contained there.

So, Trish and I strap into the harnesses as Debbie and Jonathon are up in the air, oh I don\'t know... 600 feet? When they come in, Trish and I move to the back of the boat and the two of us are hooked up to the parachute. They tell us when and we shoot up. As soon as we get in the air we both fly forward and were hanging upside down. As we right ourselves, I can hear the other four in the boat laughing their asses off. The guys driving the boat dip us in the water because at this point I am just hanging in my harness. You can see this in the picture here.\r\n\r\n<img name=\"parasailingtimmytrish02cut.jpg\" />\r\n\r\nBack in my harness they zip us up into the wild blue yonder. It was one of the most awesome experiences. You are just floating there, 600 feet up. It\'s amazing. It\'s peaceful. It\'s humiliating when you slide out of your harness and the straps around your legs pull up and start strangling your wedding tackle. Which I did. Now at 600 feet I am just hanging from the harness laughing and in pain. Trish starts to try to kick me in the \"ding-ding.\" This happened about half way through the ride so I stayed up there like that a good 6-7 minutes.\r\n\r\nThey brought us back in for another dip in the water to fix the harness so I can get back on the boat.

Occasionally I go on binges that would test the patience of the most understanding girlfriend, as I am lost to books and magazines and blogs.</p>\r\n<p>Feng shui is a term used to describe the arrangement of object in your space.  <a href=\"http://www.answers.com/?tname=feng-shui\"><cite>Answers</cite> defines feng shui</a> as <q>The Chinese art or practice of positioning objects, especially graves, buildings, and furniture, based on a belief in patterns of yin and yang and the flow of chi that have positive and negative effects</q>, though in the ever increasing bastardization of language, it can be applied to information as well.

Its a talk given by Jeff Tweedy and Lawrence Lessig called <em>Who Owns Culture</em> given at the New York Public Library.  Download it.  If you can\'t get a good seed message me and I will send it to you.  It\'s a good talk.  There are some visuals that I totally missed because I listened to it in the car but if you have time I\'m sure the video is good too.</p>\r\n<p>Regardless they make some great points and some wonderful discussion.  They discuss the fact that the movie industry and music industry and publishing industry have taken control of, or attempted to take control of creativity and culture at large.  They discuss how copyright is stiffling creativity. It\'s control is against the spirit of art where creativity builds on creativity and influences the future and the way people think and feel.</p>\r\n<p>I was just going to leave it as a link on the side, but then I heard a piece called <em><a href=\"http://www.autistici.com/petsounds.htm\">hippocamp ruins pet sounds</a></em>.  I was led to the project from who knows where and I downloaded the album.  It\'s the 25th anniversary tribute to the Beach Boys album <em>Pet Sounds</em>.  It\'s amazing.  I really enjoyed it.  A couple weeks later I saw <a href=\"http://downhillbattle.org/node/view/505>this post on downhill battle</a>.  Autistici was forced to take this work offline for copyright reasons.</p>\r\n<p>It was infuriating to me.  It\'s crap.  Why stiffle a work that, if you read the bit about it on the <a href=\"http://www.autistici.com/petsounds.htm\">autistici</a> page they are obviously paying tribute to and encouraging purchase of the album.  But they were forced to take it down.  This brings forward the rediculous nature of the beast.  The lack of forward thinking and the control of the greedy suits who control the industry.</p>\r\n<p>I liked the opinions of Lessig and Tweedy.  I think that technology will lead to a future more like the vision of these two forward thinkers.  Download <em><a href=\"http://wilcoworld.net/wired/\">Who Owns Culture</a></em>, download <em><a href=\"http://downhillbattle.org/node/view/505\">hippocamp ruins pet sounds</a></em>.

I\'ll give you a minute.</p>\r\n<p>Although I enjoy science, I am not much of a scientific reader.  That is, I don\'t buy books on scientific theory because if the science is too heavy I lose interest too quickly.  I read <em>A Brief History of Time</em> but I got more out of <em>Who\'s Afraid of Schrodinger\'s Cat</em>.  Not because it was better, just because it was written in chunks that were more easily digested.  Regardless, this is partially a science book.</p>\r\n<p>It\'s also a history book.  This is the reason I bought it.  The delicate weave between history and science is very enjoyable.  It reminded me alot of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0393324826/qid=1118881976/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/102-3675225-1108125\">Stiff</a> (which is one of my favorite books all time)(although this one didn\'t really come close).

Who were their friends and enemies.  What did they do for fun.  Insecurities? Fears? Ultimate goals and interests.  Electric Universe offered that extra piece of the puzzle that I yearn for.

Here\'s my advice for finding your dream joint.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Take your time.  There are tons of properties for rent all the time.  Wait until you find the one you want.</li>\r\n<li>Search all possible sources.  Newspapers, online directories, craigslist and realtors.  Don\'t discount driving around and looking for signs.  Not only will you find tons of things that aren\'t advertised, sometimes before anyone else has gotten a chance to look at the place, but it also helps give you an opportunity to see the neighborhood and learn the roads and stores in the immediate area.</li>\r\n<li>Explore all of your options.  Look at as many places as you can.  You have to live there for a year.  This is a big decision and could make your life a living hell or a wonderful paradise.</li>\r\n<li>If you call an advert for a place and it takes them four days to get back to you, this is not the place for you.  If it takes them four days to get back to you when you are trying to give them money, they will never call you back when you need them after you move in.  You have more chance of drinking every ounce of water pouring from your hot water heater than you do of the rushing over to help you.</li>\r\n<li>Know what you want before you even look. Number of bedrooms, price range, acceptable areas, types of housing.  Make sure you know what you are don\'t want.  What\'s going to be a deal breaker and what are you willing to bend on.</li>\r\n<li>Find out what the other tenants are like.  If this means breaking down the doors of your future neighbors, so be it.  I don\'t know if you can take the landlord\'s or heaven forbid the realtor\'s opinion into account but i suppose they would have a reasonable idea.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Above all the most important thing is to be patient and don\'t lose your cool.

	(231,1,'2005-06-22 21:11:21','2005-06-23 02:11:21','\r\nTimmy Crowe\r\nTuesday Night English Party\r\n05.01.2003\r\nResearch and opinion\r\n \r\n	Student loans have become a large part of the college experience for youth across America.  Enrollment at collegesâ€™ country wide rises every year and tuition costs follow suit.  Student loans help many students make it through college.  What effect do these loans have on a student when they are planning and paying for their education?\r\n	A little background on student loans is needed before this question can be answered.  There are two loan programs available.  The first is the William D. Ford loan; the money for these loans comes from the government.  The second program is called the Federal Family Education Loan.  The money for these loans comes from lending institutions and is guaranteed by the federal government.  Each of these programs has two types of loans.  There are subsidized, which are based on financial need, and unsubsidized.  Students who receive subsidized loans do not begin accruing interest until they have been out of school for at least 6 months.  For those who are not in financial distress, unsubsidized loans begin accruing interest as soon as they receive money. (Student Guide, pp.1-13)\r\n	â€œAn American Council of Education study found â€¦between 1994 and 2000, funds utilized for student loans increased from a total of $24.7 to $31.6 million dollars representing an increase of 27% over the period.â€ (Manton)  The average amount borrowed by 62 graduates who participated in a survey at Texas A&M $10,975.40.  40% of those who participated said they would not have been able to complete their schooling without student loans and 61% felt that it would have been difficult to complete their program but they could have made it through.(Manton)\r\n	The purpose of the study was to find out whether students, if given a chance to go back, would change the amount of money they borrowed for school. The study showed â€œthat a significant percentage of the graduates would borrow less if given another opportunity to do so.â€ (Manton) Some would have borrowed the same amount and very few students who participated would have borrowed more money.  This shows that students do not necessarily believe that college is worth a life of debt post-graduation.\r\n	To make matters worse the cost of college tuition has gone up â€œ43% at private colleges and 49% at public institutions since 1992.â€ (â€œDegrees of Debtâ€)  Student aid has not grown with the cost of education.  The highest amount that a student can borrow is still only $23,000.  Kiplingerâ€™s Personal Finance published that studentâ€™s are relying more on credit cards and private lenders to pay for school.  This makes paying back student loans difficult after graduation due to other expenses amounted during school.\r\n	This leads us to a growing default rate on student loans.  After nine years of falling default rates on student loans, â€œthe default rate climbed to 5.9 percent for the fiscal year of 2000, up from 5.6 percent the year before.â€ (Cavanagh)  Higher tuition costs have contributed to this rise.  According to Education Department data, â€œaverage student loan debt rose to $16,928 in 1999-2000, almost twice the amount as eight years before.â€ (Cavanagh)  The federal government is afraid that this trend will continue.  They are pushing schools to counsel their students in debt management and expect schools to push there students to pay loans back on time.  Some school have been penalized for having high default rates by banning students at those school from borrowing money at all.\r\n\r\n	Penalties for default are not going to solve the problem of the financial end of the American higher education system.  If the federal government is worried about the condition of the student loan programs, perhaps it is time for reform.  This reform needs to come from two separate directions.  \r\n	The first group that needs to reform their systems is the schools themselves.  The United States puts a lot of emphasis on education at every level.  College is a necessary part of life.  Education is paramount for someone who wants to further their career.  With this knowledge universities have students in a position that they cannot avoid.  Students do not have much of a choice but to pay.  The universities need to lower the costs of education.  If lowering costs is out of the question then opportunities must be offered to balance the costs.  The rise in tuition costs should be slowed considerably as well.\r\n	The Universities are not the only organization who is to blame for the debt of students.  The federal government must reform the program.  The ceiling of borrowing should be raise to eliminate the need to use credit cards and private lenders to pay for school.  If students have fewer loans outside of the government sponsored programs they are more likely to pay their loans back.\r\n	Second, the federal government must lean on the educational institutions to lower their tuition costs.  Furthermore more free money should be given to students directly.  Corporations could be offered special tax benefits for helping employees pay off their loans when they start working.  Interest rates could also be lowered or interest eliminated altogether on student loans.\r\n	Students face a future of debt greater then those who never attend college.  College costs mount and become hard to pay back after graduation.  Reform is needed from multiple players in the college game to save college-goers from the curse of the damned and show them that college can offer them the fruits of the gods. \r\nWorks cited\r\n\r\nCavanagh, Sean.  â€œCollege-Loan Defaults Up, Reversing 9-Year Trend.â€ Education Week Vol.22 Issue 4 09/25/2002: p20\r\n\r\nâ€œDegrees of Debt.â€ Kiplingerâ€™s Personal Finance Vol.57 Issue 4 Apr 2003: p30\r\n\r\nManton, Edgar and Donald English. â€œDo recent college graduates regret the amount of funds borrowed for educational purposes?â€ Education Vol. 123 Issue1 Fall 2002: p82\r\n\r\nStudent Guide to Financial Aid, (2001-2002).

It was commonplace for us to stand outside of the theater after a movie.  These werenâ€™t your usual early twenties individuals.  These were the sort of people that would drink maple syrup so they could throw it up and cause a chain reaction of vomiting.  These were the sort of people that would steal your keys when you passed out at a party and drive your car onto your front lawn and leave you asleep at the wheel.  These were the sort of people who would start a international hacker organization, recruit thousands of people worldwide, plaster their own website with racist propaganda and report themselves to the anti-defamation league.  They did these things all in the name of fun.  These werenâ€™t normal people.  They were straight up hooligans.\r\n	I was standing in the middle of this rabble getting colder and colder.  It was the dead of winter but we all still insisted on standing there trying to figure out what we were going to do knowing full well there was nothing to do at 3a.m.  I leaned over to my girlfriend and whispered into her ear something that every girl longs to hear from her boyfriend.  â€œDrive-by?â€\r\n	â€œRace you to the car,â€ she whispered back as she started to sprint through the empty parking lot toward my beat up old Chevy.   My car was fondly referred to by my friends as the â€œanimulâ€ (Lumina backwards).  The things we had done to that car would turn my mothers face white if she knew, luckily she wasnâ€™t there.\r\n	We arrived at the car and jumped in.  As I started the engine, she pulled my semi-automatic paintball gun out from under my front seat.  I jammed the car into reverse and chirped out of my parking spot.  My friends looked up at me as I slammed the car into drive and they scattered.  They knew what was about to happen.  By the time I pulled up to where they had been standing just seconds before they were already jumping into their cars and replaying the scene that Trish and I had perform.  I rolled up next to my friend Ricky and he dove in the back seat of the car.  He pulled his paint-ball gun out from beneath his seat and we sped off into the direction of the other cars in the upper part of the parking lot.  \r\n	There were five other cars with us that night.  They all had at least four people in them. Most of these people had paintball guns with them as well.   We passed them traveling at about 75 mph.  They were still climbing into the cars and as we passed Ricky and Trish sprayed their windshields with paintballs.  When we had pulled about fifty yards past them I ripped my wheel around and the back end of my car spun out and we zoomed in the other direction, heading back to where they were sitting.  \r\n	While I spun my car around they started to pull out of their spots.  They were already firing on each other from close range.  They went in five different directions and started pulling maneuvers like I had.  Dodging light posts, narrowly missing head-on collisions and spinning donuts in the parking lot, we toyed with death like it was a flame on a match.  My car was hit with about 300 paintballs and we all decided we would meet at the local diner for coffee before we went in.  Four of the cars pulled away and I remained behind and talked to my friend Code who was driving the sixth car.  \r\n	We werenâ€™t paying attention as we talked because two security trucks pulled up to our cars.  One pulled in front of our cars.  The other pulled behind us.  We couldnâ€™t drive anywhere.  My arm was still hanging out of the window with a gun in my hand.  One of the guards walked up and took the gun out of my hand.\r\nâ€œWeâ€™ve called the police,â€ he said. â€œThey should be here any minute.â€  Then he walked away and waited about fifteen feet from our cars.\r\nâ€œIâ€™m screwed,â€ Code said with a terrified look on his face.  Code was in the Air Force and wasnâ€™t supposed to be so far from his base, let alone speeding around shooting paintballs at other cars at high speeds.  \r\nWhen the police arrived the first officer took the gun from the security guard and walked over to me and handed it right back to me.  He took our IDâ€™s and the IDâ€™s of everyone in the car.  Then he walked over to one of seven cruisers that had surrounded us.  \r\nAbout twenty minutes later he walked back to my car and gave our IDâ€™s back.  â€œYouâ€™re lucky your buddy is in the Air Force, cause I donâ€™t really feel like doing the paperwork involved in arresting him.  I donâ€™t think the chief is going be too happy when he finds out what you are doing while youâ€™re out with his daughter. â€œ  He looked over at my girlfriend and handed her ID back.  â€œHi Trish,â€ he said.  She smiled and waved at him as she smiled sheepishly.  \r\nWe got off scott free that night.  Its just too bad it wasnâ€™t so easy the next time I visited her house.\r\n','Paintball Drive-by',0,'',NULL,NULL,'draft','closed','closed','','paintball-drive-by','','','2005-06-22 21:12:10','2005-06-23 02:12:10','',0,'http://veryraw.com/history/2005/06/paintball-drive-by/',0,'','',0),
	(233,1,'2005-06-22 21:12:45','2005-06-23 02:12:45','	Of all the things people have told me I am incorrigible is the most frequently used.  If I had a dollar for every time I was told that I am incorrigible I would probably have about 100 dollars.  Not only is it the most frequently used word by people when they are regaling me with their unwelcome and unnecessary evaluations of my personality, but it is my personal favorite.\r\n	Webster dictionary defines incorrigible as â€œNot corrigible; incapable of being corrected or amended; bad beyond correction; irreclaimable; as, incorrigible error.â€  Yes, thatâ€™s me.  There probably isnâ€™t a single word in the English language that better describes me as this word.  \r\n	Other words that have been used to describe my behavior include immature, hardheaded, and unreasonable.  These donâ€™t apply to my personality as well as incorrigible does.  Immature is when you arenâ€™t grown up enough to understand what you are doing wrong.  Hardheaded is a good adjective to use when you are describing someone who wonâ€™t admit they are wrong or someone that always thinks that their idea is the best.  Lastly, unreasonable doesnâ€™t apply to me because unreasonable implies that someone is irrational.  I am irrational at times, but in general, I react in a mature manner to things.\r\n	I have a tendency to refuse other peopleâ€™s advice or concerns.  I donâ€™t accept that what they have been through could ever apply to what I am saying, thinking or doing.  I insist on learning everything the hard way.  No one knows best but me.  \r\n	My most famous incorrigible behavior is my driving.  I love to drive.  I will always be the driver.  No matter how many cars are around, I am always driving.  Furthermore, I love to drive fast and reckless.  There is nothing more exhilarating to me then driving two, sometimes three times the speed limit.  The tighter I cut a corner or the closer I come to hitting the cars in front or behind me while I change lanes, the more fun I have.  \r\n	I got my license when I was 19 years old.  Sixteen months later the state took my license away for 2 years.  In those sixteen months I was pulled over fifty-five times.  I received eight major speeding violations, one violation for running a red light, one reckless endangerment, one inattentive driving and countless non-point citations.  I was pulled over in five different states and every county in southeastern Pennsylvania.  At the beginning of my suspension there were 24 points on my license.  \r\n	In September of 2002 my license was returned.  Since then I have been pulled over seven times and received one ticket, which carries four points and a hearing.  In addition I have been in five accidents.  Only one of those accidents wasnâ€™t my fault.  \r\n	Over the course of my time with a license I have been told by countless people to slow down and drive more safely.  I may never learn.  Incorrigible is the most admirable of all the childish behaviors because it shows tenacity, consistency and a lack of gall toward the people who try to change your habits.  These three things make an incorrigible person more tolerable then someone with the other qualities above because you can count on this quality to always be there.\r\n','driving habits',0,'',NULL,NULL,'draft','closed','closed','','driving-habits','','','2005-06-22 21:12:45','2005-06-23 02:12:45','',0,'http://veryraw.com/history/2005/06/driving-habits/',0,'','',0),

I have a little place to call my own, a hide-away of sorts.  I spend a lot of time here and I have grown to like it.</p>\r\n<p>Itâ€™s sort of dark here.  There isnâ€™t much light at all.  I would use my lighter but I am afraid that I will set something ablaze and start an inferno.  Thereâ€™s a lot of stuff in here.  I think there is a coat and boots underneath of me.  The tire iron is poking me in the leg and the jack is underneath my rear end.   I think there are some bottles of oil here too.  There must be a leak.  I can feel water sloshing around underneath of me.  Everything around me is drenched.  I shiver every time I am here.  Itâ€™s cold and damp. The smell is a combination of oil, mildew and exhaust.  It makes me a little light-headed but it goes away when I get hit with an overwhelming smell of gasoline.  Even though my friends are all here itâ€™s very muffled.  I canâ€™t hear much of anything.  I can only hear them when everyone gets very loud.</p>\r\n<p>My friends are having such a good time with me here. They are laughing and whooping and screaming and cheering.  All they talk about is how great it is that I am here.  It makes me feel like a celebrity.  The thrill wears off after a while though.  They quiet down and I think they forgot that I am even here.  Theyâ€™ll come back though.  The entertainment is too appealing to them. </p>\r\n<p>I donâ€™t necessarily like it here though.  I donâ€™t have a choice though.  When my friends came to get me tonight, they convinced me to play out a kidnapping scenario in front of a huge crowd of people.  They snatched me up and stuffed in the trunk at the Dairy Queen and sped away.  They promised to let me out, but I should have known that they wouldnâ€™t.  My friends are jerks.  I should expect this sort of thing.  The problem is that they have been driving over curbs and speed bumps for the last hour.  I am getting tired of it.  I am hurt. But they are having fun still.</p>\r\n<p>Most people would say that I am sick for thinking this is a great place.  Itâ€™s terrible, it smells and itâ€™s painful.  They are probably right, but the thing that makes it great is that next time it will be someone else.</p>\r\n<p><em>written February 2003</em></p>\r\n','The Special Place',0,'',NULL,NULL,'static','closed','closed','','the-special-place','','','2006-03-24 14:59:29','2006-03-24 19:59:29','',0,'http://veryraw.com/the-special-place/',0,'','',0),

I lean forward toward my steering wheel and in the corner of my eye I see something fly in the window.  It hits my shoulder and I feel it land on my back.  Trish starts screaming, \"Oh my god pull over! It\'s huge!\"  I have no idea what the thing is.  For all I know its a freaking vampire bat or a flying rabid baby or something worse.  I start screaming, \"Just get it off!\" She won\'t touch it.  </p>\r\n<p>As I start to brake, but while I am still movng, I throw the car in park.  The car comes to a grinding, painful stop and the two of us fly out of the car.  Now the two of us, twitching with a case of the heebie-jeebies are looking all over the car for this thing.  She describes it to me as what sounds like a huge flying roach or waterbug.  It had apparently crawled into the back seat when I jumped out ofthe car.  We couldn\'t find it.  After about five minutes, standing in the middle of the street in Media with all of the doors of the car wide open we decided toget back in the car and move on. </p>\r\n<p>Twenty minutes later, the thing flies out of the back seat and past Trish\'s head.  It lands near the windshield then flies to the dashboard.  Trish starts freaking again.  I managed to actually stop the car this time in my panic to get the hell out of the car. Didn\'t manage to pull off the road mind you, just stop the car.  We are running around the car looking for a stick to use to chase it out of the car.  I find one and it avoids my stick and runs to the other side of the dash.  I was terrifed it was going to run down into the dashboard and lay eggs in the heater or something.  I manage to knock it to the floor then out of the car.  </p>\r\n<p>When the dust settled, we stood outside of the car staring at each other, we noticed that there was a guy, possibly one of our future neighbors, standing in his yard watching the two of us the whole time.

	(239,1,'2005-06-28 12:46:38','2005-06-28 17:46:38','<p>A few months ago I was having an issue with a module I was developing for the website at the college.  It\'s a problem that I have run into before but simply ignored it because it wasn\'t an enormous problem.  You submit a form.  It performs some action.  You hit the back button.  You receive a message that reads something like this...</p>\r\n<blockquote>The page you are tyring to view contains POSTDATA. If you resend the data, any action the form carried out (such as search or online purchase) will be repeated. To resend the data, click OK. Otherwise, click Cancel.</blockquote>\r\n<p>So it\'s not a big deal but whats going to happen is that whatever action had just been performed is going to be performed again.  This may not matter if the action is updating a message or deleting based on some unique identifier, but if the action is a purchase from an online store or adding a user account, this could cause some serious issues.</p>\r\n<p>The problem originates in the HTTP Header where this information is stored.  The browser remembers all the information that it sent in a request to the web server you are communicating with.  So theoretically if you clear that information from the browser you will eliminate the problem.</p>\r\n<p>My solution to the issue is to tell the browser not to cache the page.  After your application does its work, you will probably redirect to a feedback page or back to the originating page to display some thanks or feedback.  Before sending the <code>redirect</code> header, send <code>cache-control</code> header.  This will tell most browsers not to cache the page.  Then if the user hits the back button, they will be sent to the page they were at prior to the form submission (back to the form itself) instead of the page that is performing the actions.  It looks like this.</p>\r\n<code>\r\n<pre>\r\n< ?php\r\n  // a bunch of stuff that performs the actions you want.\r\n\r\n  // some headers to disable caching\r\n    header(&quot;Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate&quot;);\r\n    header(&quot;Cache-Control: post-check=0, pre-check=0&quot;, false);\r\n    header(&quot;Pragma: no-cache&quot;);\r\n\r\n  // send it to a new page.\r\n    header(&quot;Location: http://veryraw.com/&quot;);\r\n?>\r\n</pre>\r\n</code>\r\n<p>There are some assumptions made here.  I generally send to a different page when a form is submitted. I do my work there then redirect to somewhere else depending on what the action performed was.  Some developers prefer to submit to the page the form is on.  In this case <a href=\"http://ad.hominem.org/log/2005/03/eliminating_the.php\">the problem would come if the page was reloaded</a> rather than if the back button was clicked.

After dropping out of Millersville University, I got a job at USAirways. I threw bags; loaded the bellies of planes.  I loved that job like Woah!, but in time realized that someday I would want more then aching knees and back. I left the job and took a less certain path.</p>\r\n<p>I do miss that job, though. I miss racing around on those tugs and conveyor belts.  Throwing other people\'s things around with wanton regard.

So I do a search for them and I come up with there <a href=\"http://gayforjohnnydepp.com/\">website</a>. Its freaking horrible. A goddamned nightmare. Let me tell you whats wrong with the site...</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The name of the band is not even on the site.  I wasn\'t sure if it was even the bands website.</li>\r\n<li>Frames.  Bloody frames.  Stop fucking using frames. You\'re not hiding anything from me, I will get what I want from your site if I want it.  Frames will not stop me.</li>\r\n<li>Flash music player.  Whats the point.  Offer me music to download. I don\'t want to listen to it on your rotten website.</li>\r\n<li>Creative non-descript titles for your links.  They aren\'t creative really, I don\'t know what they are.  I don\'t know how to find the content I want.</li>\r\n<li>The worst offense of all.  How do I buy your fucking album.  The sites I am refered to are un-navigable. I can\'t find your album anywhere.  Why would I ever buy an album from a store I can\'t find anything in.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>After all this I still want to buy the album but I don\'t know how.  I tried amazon but got no where.  Putting your music on amazon isn\'t selling out, its smart.  Why would you make your music so difficult to find.</p>\r\n<p>Just for prosperity sake I should mention a few other things that bother me in addition to those mentioned above about band websites...</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Stop using Flash</strong>.  I can\'t link to a part of your site if you are using flash.  It makes it impossible to navigate and I don\'t bloody care how many things you can get to fly across my screen in like three seconds.  <a href=\"http://handsomeboymodelingschool.com/\">Handsome Boy Modeling School</a> is a classic example of the overuse of Flash. If you click that link there is a good chance your computer will come to a stand still and your browser will crash.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Don\'t put a link up to content then put an under construction page there</strong>. It\'s so annoying.  I hate in the off occasion that I can actually find what I want on a band site the content isn\'t actually there. <a href=\"http://thebloodbrothers.com/flash.html\">The Blood Brothers</a> are not only a great example of this (try downloading a song or two), but they also use worthless un-navigable flash.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Offer me some sample music</strong>. I mean full songs.  Snippets never get stuck in my head and make me hunt your album down.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Give me metadata</strong>. Before you upload those songs to your site, make sure the metadata is proper so I can find it again in my music player later.  If I can\'t find it, I can\'t listen to it again and again, therefore it will never get stuck in my head and force me to buy your album. I downloaded two songs from the <a href=\"http://www.yeahyeahyeahs.com/\">Yeah Yeah Yeahs</a> website last night and they had no metadata. It took me like five minutes to find it again once I imported it into my itunes library.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>This is certainly not a comprehensive list.  This is merely a list of the things that irritate me most about band sites. When I go to a band site, I want to know history, lyrics, discography and I want to download media.  Give me information on your site.

Trish and I have been in our new place for a week now and things are really getting together.  I am finally hanging pictures and mirrors after some painting and organizing.  We have filled the dumpster for our building twice now with things we are throwing away and the best part, I went out and bought a grill last night.  Life is good.</p>\r\n<p>The move has really initiated a life style change of sorts.  I call this my quality of life move.  Not only am I living with Trish now, which lets me see her more often, but it also cuts all driving times significantly.  I have a 5 minute drive to work now.  Instead of getting home around 6:30, I\'m finishing dinner around 6:30.  This obviously gives me a lot more time at night to do what I want at night.  Furthermore, I am not making three trips a week to Trish\'s house a whopping 40 miles from my house.</p>\r\n<p>The other difference is that with a refridgerator full of food and beer, I end up eating out less.

	(248,1,'2005-07-24 19:26:40','2005-07-25 00:26:40','<p>A few years ago I started thinking about what would happen if my parents house burnt down and all my childhood images were lost, or worse, all the images of my parents and their parents were lost too.  A thourough family history lost to flame. That\'s rough. That\'s alot of history. I have commented before that I think I am the single most photographed person on earth.  There are literally ten-thousand images of me over the course of my life.  My brother and sisters too.</p>\r\n<p>The though of this made me cringe.  I enjoy not only leafing through the images but feel that someday these will be the things that allow my children\'s children to get an idea of who I was and how life was when I was young (that is to say that some wonderful science isn\'t found to prevent me from becoming a vegetable by eighty years old). So I decided that the best thing to do was to scan every single image in my mother\'s house (I swear I wasn\'t high).  It\'s an undertaking that has nearly swallowed me.  Sometimes I am really into it and other times I really couldn\'t care less.</p>\r\n<p>I\'ve scanned images from my father\'s and mother\'s childhoods and paintings and poems and handprints from all of my siblings.  I\'ve scanned images so old that no one remembers what they are anymore.</p>\r\n<p>The problem then is how the hell do I remember what these images are and who is in them and when they were taken.  There\'s a bounty of information that you might need when you actually want to use these images later.  File names and folder structures can only take you so far on this.</p>\r\n<p>I searched and searched for software to help me with the collection of image information.  I tried Picassa, it nearly solved the problem but wasn\'t perfect for what I was looking for.  Then I finally tried <a href=\"http://flickr.com\">flickr</a>. As you may already know I am madly in love with flickr.  But there is a reason for my childish infatuation which stretches far beyond the desire to share and lookat photos.</p>\r\n<p>When images are uploaded they are tagged (categorized) and dated and captioned and titled.  Most importantly though, they are backed up somewhere where the evil life erasing fire can\'t get it (theoretically).</p>\r\n<p>This still doesn\'t solve the issue of sitting down at the kitchen table with the kids and leafing through your albums telling stories and laughing like any good hallmark family does, but its just the setup.</p>','Laying out a photo album of thousands of digital images: the setup.',0,'',NULL,NULL,'publish','closed','closed','','laying-out-a-photo-album-setup','','','2005-07-24 19:26:47','2005-07-25 00:26:47','',0,'http://veryraw.com/history/2005/07/laying-out-a-photo-album-of-thousands-of-digital-images-an-idea/',0,'','',9),

The archiving and eventual laying out of thousands of images into comprehensive annotated album is no simple task.  I may have a working plan for solving this issue.</p>\r\n<p>The first part involves <a href=\"http://flickr.com\">flickr</a>. Using their developers API, an application, web-based or stand-alone, would be developed which would allow you to look at your flickr photostream in chronological order (as opposed to date uploaded order).  The application would allow you to do the following things.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Ensure that the date taken information attached to the image was correct.  This can be done in flickr but by viewing them in chronological order would allow you to ensure images flow in time.</li>\r\n<li>Correct and elaborate on captions tags, and titles.</li>\r\n<li>Define tags.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Define tags may not be the right wording.  Rather than define I should say tell whether they are people, places, things or descriptions.  This is important later.</p>\r\n<p>The key to this application is to focus on metadata.  The more clear your data is now the better your final product would be.  With that information, the application would output an XML file with all of the information in it.</p>\r\n<h4>This is where the idea gets bit hairy</h4>\r\n<p>With the file outputted with the flickr information, a template of some sort would be created to lay all of this information out into quark or inDesign. Rules would be set for how to show captions and titles and dates.  The template would have to know which categories of tags to display, people and places, or just places, or just people, How large the largest images are allowed to be.  Whatever.  There are probably already examples of this somewhere.  I don\'t know.  I\'m a web professional not a print designer.  Then the tags would be used as an index so you could figure out what pages in the book each tag appears on.</p>\r\n<p>When printed and bound this would create an all inclusive album of your images and details in chronological, look at it with your kids on the kitchen table book.  It creates a history, with details of your family and your life.  Then a disk could be included with the high-res original of each image organized into folders by page if someone wanted to have a printed picture.  But it allows you to have a real, tangable, actual photo album that pictures won\'t fall out of and get misplaced.  The details are all there and no one will forget whats in the pictures.  Not to mention, if you have a family the size of mine, it would be easy to print a volume for my brother and sisters, parents, whoever without too much effort.  With on-demand printing, this would be rather easy.</p>\r\n<p>The point to all this is that although flickr may not be perfect, what I am trying to do is get all of my images in one place, with proper information.  Then I can work with it however I want.  I have no doubt that someday I will want to abandom flickr, but by then I would hope I have this project long finished.  Saving my memories, not just for me, but for my children and their children too, thats what the intent is</p>','Laying out a photo album of thousands of digital images: the solution/idea.',0,'',NULL,NULL,'publish','closed','closed','','laying-out-a-photo-album-solution','','','2005-08-04 13:10:26','2005-08-04 18:10:26','',0,'http://veryraw.com/history/2005/07/laying-out-a-photo-album-of-thousands-of-digital-images-the-solutionidea/',0,'','',4),

I spent hours upon hours throwing away every little thing I could think of throwing out.  But after the actual move, quickly realized that I hadn\'t thrown out nearly as much as I previously thought.

Taking a quick glance around the apartment as I write this and I see even more crap that I could ditch but just haven\'t.

If you haven\'t used it in the last six months (maybe less), throw it away.  You don\'t need it and after about 2 weeks you won\'t remember that you ever had it.  None of those possesions are really needed and you will feel better when you don\'t have as much stuff.  When everything you own is visible to you all the time, and nothing is stored away in boxes somewhere you will feel better.  Like a load has been lifted from your shoulders.

And it was continued in <a href=\"http://veryraw.com/history/2005/08/geoblogger-what-an-awesome-application-should-be/\">the comments of my last entry</a>.  The idea is a cross country ride.  A tour from ocean to ocean.  <a href=\"http://www.biketouring.net/\">John Dorsey</a> has written a really extensive account of his first trip across and the adventure that the idea offers is nearly more than I can handle.  It sounds exciting and fun.</p>\r\n<p>There are obvious issues though.  I am currently about 50 pounds outside of the weight I would need to be to make a ride like that.  John says that the only thing that can prepare you  for six weeks of riding 75 miles a day is six weeks of riding 75 miles a day, but I must say that being in relatively proper shape from the start will make it easier.  I figure two years will be a proper amount of time to train for something like this.  Weights and eating right and all.</p>\r\n<p>I need to do some reasearch on bikes and get a new lighter bike.  Mine currently weighs about 35 pounds.  I should probably get a lighter one if I am going to strap 100 pounds of gear to it.  I also need to get my endurance up and take some really long rides.  I would like to make the ride to King of Prussia sometime in September.

It\'s compelling and interesting.  And the best part of all is that up until the very end you don\'t know whether they are actually going to find him or not.

The whole search is about love and hope.  In the end the feeling of the movie isn\'t cheapened by a happy go lucky, everything is perfect,  remember you ending.  She finds him but he has no idea who she is.  Is she disappointed? No.  She\'s happy that she found the one she loves.  The theme of the movie is preserved and everyone gets what they want.

Not only do they have very detailed information about the US and the world but they can also be carried around where ever I go.  I don\'t even need google maps. </p>\r\n<p>The whole idea strikes me as wreaking of two problems.  The first is the blatant overuse of the terrorist threat.  Its politicians preying on the fears of their citizens.  Its politicians making a sad attempt to convince their constituents that they are doing something when most of us know that politicians do nothing but fuel the bureaucracy of the government.  Second it shows how little politicians understand about the direction that the future is heading and the impact technology is going to have on it.  Google maps has not provided access to previously secret information.  Google maps has  simply given every person with access to a computer and an internet connection the ability to see it for free.

This is not to say that the investment is a waste and won\'t get me somewhere.  I mean that for the most part the things I learn in my IS classes are things I already have a good deal of knowledge about from work or personal reading.  I am mostly self-taught.  I don\'t think that I am perfect by any means but a lot of my opinions about technology and web development and process are developed based on the reading of many wise individuals and hours  of thinking on my own about these topics, rather than ideas that are forced on me by a select few professors.</p>\r\n<p>I am taking two classes this semester.  Project Management and Database Design.  These are two topics that I have read about excessively.  They are two things that I have thought about at length and they are subjects that I have alot of opinions on (as if there\'s anything I don\'t have an opinion about).  Regardless this semester has been somewhat of an eye opener for me.  There are oodles of concepts that I have thought I have understood in the past but by going to class and sitting through it from beginning to end, I am making connections that I haven\'t made before.  I am learning terms for things and ways of discussing concepts that I could never quite put into words.</p>\r\n<p>My point is that although I have in the past found school a little tedious, this semester is different.  I am learning things that I have already learned all over again for the first time.  I\'m going to class and I\'m loving it.  There\'s conversation and debate and I\'m loving it.

Making things easier to find and making sure information is only maintained in one place has been a key objective of ours.  Basically its easier to maintain and less confusing to our customers.  It was pointed out to me in a meeting yesterday that it was nearly impossible to find directions to the various campuses on our site.  The issue was that they were buried in a page that had a list of campuses.  The campus names linked to pages that profiled the campus.  On that page there was a link to the directions for that campus\' county.  Then finally on that page you would click on a link that jumped to the part of the page that had the directions to that campus.  Little bit of overkill.</p>\r\n<p>Since google released the <acronym title=\"application programming interface\">API</acronym> for their maps I have been toying with them and attempting to get them to do what I wanted them to do so I could improve the directions on the college\'s homepage.  So after my meeting yesterday, when it was made abundantly clear to me that I was not the only person who had issues with the directions situation on the site, I sat down and forged through and finished the map.  You can see it on the <a href=\"http://www.dccc.edu/locations/\">locations page</a>.  I am really very excited about this.  You click on one of our locations and get a form to enter your address and when you submit you go to <a href=\"http://local.google.com/\">google local</a> for directions from your door to ours.</p>\r\n<p>Not only that but I also streamlined the content on that page so they linked only to directions and maps for each location.  This of course is all in an effort to make the site more usable for our customers.

I\'ve been left high and dry for most of it.  At some point I believe most of the things I have been working on became very similar to each other.  There was nothing new to learn.  I shouldn\'t say there was nothing new, I should say those particular projects have been so similar that they haven\'t involved anything I haven\'t done before.\r\n\r\nWhen I first got into web development, I was learning 400 new things a day.  Everything was new because I knew nothing.  As my skills and my knowledge of the tools I was using grew, the frequency of the <em>a-ha</em> moment was less frequent.  Every subsequent project becomes less exciting and soon I start to feel like I am canning tuna on an assembly line.  Everything is the same.  Nothing is special.\r\n\r\n<strong>This is the curse of the ever raising bar.</strong>\r\n\r\nI thought for a long time that this was just my lack of interest in my field of choice.  I thought that maybe I had outgrown my profession already.  Recently though I picked up a few new technology books.  They were skills that I had thought about picking up for a long time but had never carried through on.  I started reading and there it was - the excitement.  It was back and raging like never before.  \r\n\r\nThese new exciting skills have turned into new ideas for new projects.  Some of which I will actually execute, other I will not.  Regardless, this curse surely applies to most professions.  The important thing is to identify it and prevent yourself from giving up on the profession altogether.  When the curse jumps up and gets you, maybe its time to learn something new, try something different or just move on to the next place.

When this age group reaches a period that they have a larger amount of free time on their hands, they are going to be pouring more of their money into new products and services.  It is important to focus on them in advertising because with larger purses and more time, they are going to make up a very significant portion of consumers.\r\n\r\nThere are several markets emphasized in â€œLove Those Boomersâ€ which have benefited from a more concentrated focus on the consumers over 50 years.  The most obvious industries are those which focus on health.  Companies like Kellogg and Dove have pushed their products by focusing on how they will help you stay healthy.  By featuring older subjects in their marketing campaigns they attract older consumers.  These efforts are important for these industries in particular because as boomers age they are more concerned with their health than they may have been in the past.  More of this industry should be focusing on this age group, rather than solely featuring 18 year old beauties in their advertising.  Organizations like health clubs and exercise equipment manufacturers could benefit from these methods as well.  Commercials for Ballyâ€™s health club or similar groups regularly feature young fit people, but there may be a heavy desire for older consumers to join, but canâ€™t picture themselves in the gym.\r\n\r\nCompanies such as Vespa are smart to market to the Boomer crowd.  These consumers have more cash than they may have in past years, and with more time on their hands after retirement they are prime targets for fun products.  Companies such as Apple or other technology companies would benefit from this idea.  Boomers were the first group of workers who had computers involved in their work lives.  By targeting this group with products that may be primarily targeted toward younger crowds, they may find that the boomerâ€™s ability to adapt to technology in the work environment would stretch to their personal lives as well. A company like Apple is a prime candidate for this.  By marketing the iPod and Mac together, they may be able to attract a whole new customer base.  Boomers may enjoy books on tape or music that could be carried where ever they go.  Coupled with products like digital cameras and software packages like iPhoto, Apple could attract customers who need a way to easily take and manage digital photos of their grandchildren or vacations.  This would bring in makers of cameras and photo printers as well.  These companies could highlight their products simplicity and show older consumers using the product with ease.\r\n\r\nThe most valid point that is driven home by â€œLove Those Boomersâ€ is that Baby Boomers are still a viable market to push products to.  Marketing efforts need to be applied differently to older consumers than they are to younger consumers. Older consumers need to see older models in advertisements to identify with a product.  Advertising which only features younger models serves to alienate the 50+ consumer group.  â€œLove Those Boomersâ€ also points out that Boomers still have a lot of life to live and they need to be taken into consideration as a viable consumer group.  \r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<hr />\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n\r\nDue: 2/2/06\r\n\r\nRead Chapters 5 and 6.\r\n\r\nRead the attached article from BusinessWeek: Love Those Boomers.Summarize this \r\narticle in no less than one full page typed. Discussion points could include how \r\norganizations target this group of consumers, what new products on the market \r\nwould you target to them, how they differ from other consumers, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLove Those Boomers \r\n             Close Window \r\n\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 24, 2005 \r\n\r\nCOVER STORY \r\n\r\n      Love Those Boomers \r\n      Their new attitudes and lifestyles are a marketer\'s dream \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      COVER STORY PODCAST\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Vespa Motor Scooters came puttering back into the U.S. market in 2000 after \r\na 15-year absence, managers at the Italian company figured their biggest \r\ncustomers would be twentysomethings looking for a cheap way to get around. But \r\nexecs at parent company Piaggio noticed something odd as they scootered back and \r\nforth to their Manhattan offices: The most enthusiastic sidewalk gawkers were \r\noften aging baby boomers who remembered the candy-colored bikes from their \r\nyouth. It turns out that boomers have lost none of their affection for Vespa. \r\nBetter yet, now they can afford to buy top-of-the-line models with all the \r\ntrimmings. Much to the company\'s surprise, consumers age 50 and older now buy a \r\nquarter of the scooters Vespa sells in the U.S. Managers figure that as they do \r\na better job of marketing to the group, that portion could grow to as much as a \r\nthird. Those aging consumers may in many ways be the perfect customer for an \r\nindulgence like a scooter. \"The boomers are particularly attractive because they \r\ntend to have free time,\" says Paolo Timoni, CEO of Piaggio USA. \"They\'re less \r\nlikely to be raising young children, and their careers are established and \r\nstable.\"\r\n\r\nThe massive postwar boomer generation that drove every significant cultural and \r\nmarketing trend for 50 years -- from Howdy Doody to the Beatles and the Ford \r\nExplorer -- is defying marketers\' expectations about how it wants to live and \r\nshop. As boomers head into their 60s starting next year, this generation, which \r\ngrew up with the mass market and witnessed the rise of network TV and then the \r\nInternet, is once again forcing marketers back to the drawing board, this time \r\nto rethink the rules for reaching graying customers.\r\n\r\nBut it matters now because half of the 77 million boomers -- people born between \r\n1946 and 1964 -- will be 50 or older this year. That\'s the age at which \r\nmarketers traditionally lose interest in consumers, believing that their choices \r\nabout which brand of toothpaste or which car to buy have long since hardened and \r\nthat their biggest earning and spending years are behind them. In the network TV \r\nbusiness, where marketers are still fixated on viewers 18 to 49, folks older \r\nthan 50 are literally dubbed \"undesirables.\"\r\n\r\nElsewhere, though, attitudes are changing -- and fast. With average life \r\nexpectancy at an all-time high of 77.4 years, more and more Americans over 50 \r\nconsider middle age a new start on life. Fewer than 20% say they see themselves \r\nstopping work altogether as they age, according to a recent Merrill Lynch & Co. \r\n() survey of boomers. Of those who plan to keep working at least part-time, 67% \r\nsaid they\'ll do so to stay mentally active, and 57% said to stay physically \r\nactive. People now in their 50s may well work longer than any previous \r\ngeneration, with more than 60% of men age 60 to 64 expected to be in the \r\nworkforce in 2012, up from about 54% in 1992, according to the Bureau of Labor \r\nStatistics.\r\n\r\nThe boomers\' collective wallet will only get fatter as they continue working. As \r\na group, people age 50 to 60 are flush, with more than $1 trillion of spending \r\npower a year, about double the spending power of today\'s 60-to-70-year-olds. \r\nThey\'re likely to be vigorous consumers as they empty the nest, take on new \r\njobs, relocate, support children they had in their 40s, go back to school, start \r\na second or third career, remarry, inherit money from their savings-minded \r\nparents, pursue new hobbies, and tackle the health issues of aging. \"Marketers \r\nare slowly waking up,\" says Matt Thornhill, president of the Boomer Project, a \r\nRichmond (Va.) consulting firm. \"If you\'re going to expand your business, you \r\nwill have to market to the aging boomer.\"\r\n\r\nPitching to folks beyond the traditional cut-off point of age 50 could help \r\ncompanies bridge the gap between the boomer generation and Generation Y, the \r\ngroup of 74 million teens and young twentysomethings that\'s almost as large as \r\nthe boomers but hasn\'t yet reached its big earning-and-spending years. In \r\ncontrast, the group in between the boomers and Generation Y, known as Generation \r\nX, comprises only about 50 million people. \"Gen Y is a big market, and its \r\nspending power will be even bigger in the future. But what about the shopper \r\ntoday?\" asks Greg Maloney, CEO of the shopping-center management business at \r\nreal estate firm Jones Lang LaSalle, which is altering the store mix at some of \r\nits malls to include more boomer-friendly shops.\r\n\r\nFiguring out how to reach the new fiftysomethings takes some effort. David G. \r\nSchreiner, vice-president for active-adult business development at Pulte Homes \r\nInc. () and its Del Webb retirement-community division, suspected that many of \r\nthe \"retirees\" living at his properties, where the average age of residents is \r\n62, weren\'t exactly pursuing the tranquil lifestyles that the company had \r\npromoted in the past. Concerned that Del Webb might be misreading its customers, \r\nSchreiner last year dispatched staffers up and down the country to interview \r\nalmost 100 Del Webb residents from Florida to Minnesota.\r\n\r\nThe reports from the field were even more colorful than Schreiner had imagined. \r\nOne Florida retiree had gone back to work driving a boat at Walt Disney World \r\nand had recently gotten married...at the amusement park. A former telephone \r\ncompany middle manager living at a Del Webb development in Northern California \r\ndescribed her life\'s mission as being \"to teach all the world to dance.\" She \r\nleads countless classes and dance events at the retirement community and \r\nelsewhere. Another Del Webb resident took up propagating water lilies and \r\nbreeding them in the many ponds that dot her development in Texas. Clearly these \r\nfolks weren\'t just hanging around and playing bingo.\r\n\r\nWhat does that mean for Del Webb\'s business? Years ago common areas in its \r\ncommunities had a \"sewing room\" or a \"computer room.\" Now, given that residents \r\nmight use an area for yoga one day and woodworking the next, rooms are simply \r\nnamed after local landmarks, such as the \"Gila\" room at the Surprise (Ariz.) \r\ndevelopment, named after a nearby river. Past Del Webb ads portrayed retirement \r\nas a reward for a lifetime of hard work and sacrifice; photos featured people \r\ncontentedly lounging by the pool. Today, Del Webb presents retirement as a \r\nsecond life with ads showing seniors pursuing their hobbies, exercising, \r\nvolunteering, or operating a home-based business. \"We have to keep up with \r\nresidents and make sure that we\'re not building shuffleboard courts,\" says \r\nSchreiner, 52. \"The War Generation was far more predictable and consistent, but \r\nthis generation gives you a bunch of paradoxes.\"\r\n\r\nVespa still works hard to create buzz among its 30-and-under customers. But it \r\nalso is pursuing older buyers more aggressively. To increase Vespa\'s visibility \r\namong mature consumers, the company has just begun advertising on the Golf \r\nCourse Home Network, a Website aimed at affluent boomers seeking homes near golf \r\ncourses (). It\'s also pursuing cross-marketing deals with mobile-home makers and \r\ncondominium developers that attract the 50-and-up crowd. To make its scooters \r\nmore appealing to boomers, Vespa has ratcheted up quality and added a full line \r\nof high-end accessories including leather seats and decorative chrome bars that \r\nappeal to older tastes and wallets.\r\n\r\nEven as companies bend over backward to address older consumers, 66% of people \r\naged 50 to 60 still agree with the notion that, overall, \"advertisers target \r\npeople younger than I am,\" according to the Boomer Project. But today\'s boomers, \r\nwith their numbers, spending power, and high-energy lives, will probably force \r\ntheir way on to marketers\' radar screens and stay there. \"Our generation still \r\nhas more living to do,\" says Nancy Blaustein, 55, of Walnut Creek, Calif., an \r\nenthusiastic shopper for all sorts of merchandise from clothes and home \r\nfurnishings to computer equipment and magazine subscriptions. \"I\'m not ready to \r\nwind down yet.\" For those companies targeting the boomers, here are five \r\nlessons:\r\n\r\nI\'M A GROWNUP, NOT JUST A BIG KID\r\nYes, our culture worships youth. But that doesn\'t mean boomers fantasize about \r\nbeing 20 again. In fact, that assumption has caused some notable marketing \r\nmishaps. In 2001, Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America Inc. began running ads \r\nfeaturing people in their twenties grooving to indie rock music. It turned out \r\nthose ads alienated the 40-to-55-year-old customers Mitsubishi coveted. Much to \r\nthe carmaker\'s dismay, in two years the average age of its buyers had dropped to \r\nabout 35 from 40. That\'s bad news because 40-to-55-year-olds tend to have better \r\ncredit scores and buy more expensive cars than 20-to-35-year-olds. Mitsubishi \r\nretooled the ads, casting fortyish actors. \"We literally had existing, valuable \r\ncustomers who were dropping us from consideration because they said they no \r\nlonger saw themselves in our brand,\" says former Mitsubishi marketing chief Ian \r\nBeavis, now head of marketing at Kia Motors America Inc.\r\n\r\nGap Inc. (), too, thinks that aging boomers will continue to be a profitable \r\nsegment of consumers so long as the company doesn\'t group them with shoppers \r\nhalf their age. Four years ago the core Gap brand tried to revive flagging sales \r\nin part by capturing the 50-plus consumer. An ad campaign using the tagline \"For \r\nEvery Generation\" featured artsy black-and-white shots of famous older boomers, \r\nincluding actors Bill Paxton and Sissy Spacek. But the inclusive slogan and \r\nmature faces didn\'t make the Gap brand grown-up.\r\n\r\nMost of the campaign still focused on younger celebrities, and Gap\'s clothes \r\nthemselves remained too bright and skimpy for the boomer body. Sales continued \r\nto decline. San Francisco-based Gap is now launching a chain called Forth & \r\nTowne, selling careerwear and casual clothes aimed at U.S. women older than 35 \r\n(BW -- Oct. 17). \"All their lives, the boomers have been catered to and felt \r\nspecial, and they would like to see something just for them,\" says Geoffrey E. \r\nMeredith, president of marketing consultancy Lifestage Matrix Marketing in \r\nLafayette, Calif.\r\n\r\nFIFTYSOMETHING CAN BE BEAUTIFUL\r\nCompanies have traditionally used models in their 20s with dewy skin to pitch \r\nproducts made for middle-aged women. The rise in Botox treatments and plastic \r\nsurgery notwithstanding, many consumers experiencing their first liver spots and \r\ncrow\'s feet are actually comfortable in their skins and pleased to see people \r\nwho look like them in ads. \"As you become older, you\'re clearer and more \r\ncomfortable about who you are,\" says Lori Bitter, partner at JWT Mature Market \r\nGroup, part of J. Walter Thompson Worldwide. \"It\'s a reality of aging. We want \r\nthe message at eye level. We may not want it sugar-coated.\"\r\n\r\nPortraying advancing age has helped Unilever Group\'s Dove soap. About 18 months \r\nago, Dove market researchers suspected that advertisers were stuck in the old \r\nhabit of presenting only youth and slimness as attractive. To confirm that idea, \r\nthey pored over video clips of commercials and leafed through pages torn from \r\nmagazines, pasting them up into photo collages. And indeed, the result was a \r\nshrine to the slim, the full-chested, and the young. Then, because Dove is a \r\nglobal brand, the researchers trekked across the U.S., South America, Europe, \r\nand Asia to ask thousands of women of all ages what they thought of the \r\nportrayal of beauty in advertising. No matter the country, they repeatedly heard \r\nthe gripe that \"the images of beauty in ads are unrealistic and unattainable,\" \r\nsays Dove marketing director Philippe Harousseau.\r\n\r\nCapitalizing on that sentiment, Dove turned industry tradition on its head last \r\nOctober with print ads using ordinary looking women instead of glamorous models. \r\nTwo of the six shots in the ad exult in advancing age. One shows a 46-year-old \r\nwoman with deep lines around her jaw and eyes and a full mane of gray hair. The \r\ncaption: \"Why aren\'t women glad to be gray?\" The payoff so far: In the nine \r\nmonths following the launch of the campaign, sales of Dove rose 3.4% from a year \r\nago. That uptick sounds small, but it\'s huge for the static soap category, and \r\nit exceeds the growth in soap sales as a whole, according to Information \r\nResources Inc., which doesn\'t include sales at Wal-Mart Stores Inc. () in its \r\ndata. Why is the campaign working? \"As you get older, fantasy and idealization \r\nare out, and reality and authenticity are in,\" says James J. Gilmartin, \r\npresident of ad agency Coming of Age Inc. in Lombard, Ill.\r\n\r\nEven cosmetics marketing, which has most adamantly equated beauty with youth, is \r\nstarting to change. Procter & Gamble Co.\'s () Cover Girl brand, where women \r\nolder than 55 account for about 20% of sales, has just launched its first line \r\nof makeup aimed at older women. The name of the product, Advanced Radiance \r\nAge-Defying Makeup, hints that advancing age can be pretty. And while ads still \r\nshow a stunningly gorgeous face, that face belongs to an older woman: 51-year \r\nold former supermodel Christie Brinkley. Cover Girl marketing head Anne Martin \r\nis betting that bringing back Brinkley, who represented the brand for two \r\ndecades until 1996, will help Cover Girl recapture boomer women who were \r\ncustomers in the 1970s and \'80s. Like many of today\'s fiftyish consumers, \r\nBrinkley is known for being energetic and active. \"She represents the new \r\n50-year-old,\" says Martin.\r\n\r\nI\'M NOT AS SET IN MY WAYS AS YOU THINK\r\nMany marketers believe that consumers\' brand preferences are locked in by age \r\n40. That might have been true for previous generations. But today\'s over-50 \r\ncrowd is just as likely, and in some cases more likely, as everyone else to try \r\ndifferent brands within a product category. According to Yankelovich Inc., 33% \r\nof consumers older than 50 agree that it\'s \"risky\" to buy an unfamiliar brand. \r\nThat\'s less than the 36% of respondents aged 16 to 34 and only a little more \r\nthan the 30% of people aged 35 to 49 who agree with that notion.\r\n\r\nIn some categories, older consumers are even more willing to brand-hop than \r\nyounger ones. According to a 2004 survey by Leo J. Shapiro & Associates LLC for \r\nDSN Retailing Today, 48% of shoppers aged 50 to 59 said they would probably \r\nswitch brands of consumer electronics, compared with 40% of all respondents. And \r\n56% of people in this group would try another brand of health-and-beauty \r\nproduct, more than the 51% figure overall.\r\n\r\nWhat gives? That flexibility stems from the fact that today\'s fiftysomethings \r\ncame of age in the 1960s culture of unlimited possibility. \"This group grew up \r\nin a time when novelty and experimentation were higher on the priority list than \r\nduring the prior generation,\" says Yankelovich President J. Walker Smith. That \r\nattitude means a 50-year-old boomer just might try that new product or service. \r\nOn the flip side, such open-mindedness also can make these consumers highly \r\nunpredictable. Honda Motor Co. () thought minivans were just for 50-and-under \r\nsoccer moms and figured that its boomer customers, once free of the children, \r\nwould move on to its fancier Acura coupes and sedans. But to its surprise, 40% \r\nof Honda minivan buyers are empty-nesters, mostly boomers over 50 who want roomy \r\nvehicles to cart around grandchildren, elderly parents, and Home Depot () hauls. \r\nHonda last fall introduced an upgraded Odyssey minivan full of leather and \r\nfeaturing zoned climate control and other pricey features wealthier older buyers \r\ncovet.\r\n\r\nI\'M REWINDING, NOT WINDING DOWN\r\nFor previous generations, age 50 meant, bluntly put, the beginning of the end. \r\nBut today\'s 50-plus crowd is far more likely to see the two or three decades \r\nahead as a second life. Watching the kids leave home, for instance, need not \r\nbring on empty-nest syndrome. According to a survey last year by Del Webb, more \r\nthan three-fifths of boomers say they\'re emotionally prepared for the kids to \r\nleave home, and more than a third believe their marriage will improve after the \r\nkids leave. \"You\'ll have time to talk to your spouse more, fewer things to argue \r\nabout, and you don\'t have to have sex in the middle of the night when you think \r\nthe kids are asleep,\" says Carolyn E. Adams-Price, a Mississippi State \r\nUniversity psychology professor who has studied empty-nesters.\r\n\r\nSeizing on that idea, Pillsbury () last October began airing a TV spot that \r\nrevels in sexy empty-nester coupledom. \"We\'re in this experimental phase,\" says \r\nthe male half of a fiftyish twosome snuggling on the couch. The couple savors \r\nPillsbury\'s Oven Baked biscuits with dinner, and as the Pillsbury Doughboy dims \r\nthe dining room lights the woman giggles: \"There\'s only so much experimentation \r\nI can take...at least at the dinner table.\"\r\n\r\nThe strategy, Pillsbury says, is to associate the empty nest with a promising \r\nstage of life. \"Marketing to this segment is all about portraying the \r\nempty-nester in a positive light,\" says Mark Toth, a marketing manager at \r\nPillsbury, a unit of Minneapolis\' General Mills Inc. () Pillsbury could be on to \r\nsomething: After only three years on the market, its frozen biscuits have the \r\nlargest market share in that product category and sales are up since the \r\ncampaign changed direction.\r\n\r\nI WANT TO LIVE LONGER AND HEALTHIER\r\nHealth issues weigh heavily on the mind of the 50-year-old boomer. The top \r\nconcern about retirement in a MetLife Inc. () survey was \"becoming sick,\" with \r\n31% of respondents citing that issue. Drug companies, of course, have always \r\ntried to cash in on the health concerns of older consumers. Now other kinds of \r\ncompanies are joining in.\r\n\r\nBut catering to health worries isn\'t as easy as it looks. Long known for Corn \r\nFlakes and sugary kiddie cereals, Kellogg Co. () in Battle Creek, Mich., in the \r\nlate 1990s launched its \"Smart Start\" line, designed for older grownups. But it \r\nlanguished for years because the packaging, marketing, and product itself \r\nweren\'t aggressive enough in promoting specific health benefits. \"The marketing \r\nand ads were generic in the way [they] talked about vitality and vitamins,\" says \r\nMark Baynes, a senior vice-president for marketing. Last year, Kellogg set out \r\nto relaunch the line. Inside the company, staffers used the term \"successful \r\naging\" as a rallying point.\r\n\r\nThis time around, Kellogg wanted to target older, health-conscious boomers who \r\nincreasingly see themselves as amateur nutritionists. The revamped line includes \r\nthree varieties: \"antioxidant,\" \"soy protein,\" and \"healthy heart.\" Each \r\npinpoints specific health claims. The front of the box from the antioxidant \r\nline, for instance, says the product can \"help support a healthy immune system.\"\r\n\r\nKellogg doesn\'t soft-pedal the message. One ad says, for example, that \"more and \r\nmore women are hospitalized for heart disease.\" Kellogg figures its audience can \r\nhandle the no-nonsense tone. \"They\'re more educated on the health risks, and if \r\nthey have a second life to fulfill, they have to take control,\" says Baynes. \r\nSince the relaunch early this year, Smart Start sales have risen 48% from a year \r\nago, while sales for cereals as a group slipped 0.2%, according to Information \r\nResources.\r\n\r\nIt\'s clear that the boomers are more comfortable with their age than marketers \r\ngive them credit for. \"It\'ll be cool to be gray,\" says consultant Meredith. Once \r\ncompanies pick up on that, they\'ll start to see green amid the silvery tones.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy Louise Lee, with David Kiley in New York\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright 2000-2004, by The McGraw-Hill Companies Inc.

This just adds numbers to the tabs.\r\n</li><li><a href=\"http://chrispederick.com/work/webdeveloper/\">Web Developer Toolbar</a> - A must if you do any html/css.  I wish there was a way yo open the cookies panel from it, but its still pretty awesome.</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://karmatics.com/aardvark/\">Aardvark</a> - Builds a little on what the old web developer toolbar did.  I don\'t know if its useful anymore.  I lets you highlight sections of a page and see what elements they are part of.</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/\">Greasemonkey</a> - add behaviors to your browser with user scripts</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://livehttpheaders.mozdev.org/index.html\">LiveHTTPHeaders</a> - This is undoubtably the most important extension I use when I am developing an application.  The ability to see everything that\'s happening is very important.  This will probably become 10 times more important when I start doing Ajax stuff.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>My new extensions from  <a href=\"http://www.snooble.com/2006/01/24/firefox-extensions/\">Andrea</a> and <a href=\"http://www.jefflouella.com/byte_this/2006/01/work_and_browse.html\">Jeff</a> are awesome.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://andy.5263.org/screengrab/\">Screengrab</a> - screenshots of an html page.

It\'s mostly because I\'m approachable and for the most part I have the ability to answer a question about computers or technology without making people feel like idiots. What drives me crazy though is when someone comes to me and asks me a question, but prefaces the question with, \"I know I\'m totally stupid for asking this question but...\"</p>\r\n<p>This is easily one of the most annoying things in the world.  I would like people to realize that my specialty, the thing I spend nearly every waking moment thinking about and one of my favorite things in the world is technology.  The reason I know how to do all the things they want to know how to do is because technology is not only my job but also my hobby.  I do not know how to teach English to people who can not speak it.  I cannot diagnose sickness and I cannot put an IV in someones viens.  I do not know how to paint or play the piano.  I know technology.</p>\r\n<p><strong>I would like people to realize that a lack of knowledge about technology does not equal stupidity.</strong></p>\r\n<p>I feel that the thought is based in the old IT stereotype.  When the helpdesk first became prominate, they were wizards and gods.  They could make computers do things that others couldn\'t do.  They took a long time and they were cocky and they made people feel like shit.  This is not the way it should be and for the most part now this is not the way it is.  Helpdesk now is as much help as it is comforting (at least it should be).</p>\r\n<p>I think that IT people in general, whether you be a developer or a networking guy or tech support, should take extra care to make people feel as though its not their job to understand every intricacy of the technical world.  I think that the technologically inclined of the world should adopt the attitude of care and comfort and help the other people of the world to realize that just because they don\'t know what they are doing does not mean they are stupid.</p>','Lack of knowledge != stupidity',0,'',NULL,NULL,'publish','closed','closed','','lack-of-knowledge-stupidity','','','2006-02-18 12:21:55','2006-02-18 17:21:55','',0,'http://veryraw.com/history/2006/02/lack-of-knowledge-stupidity/',0,'','',4);

These crickets are a tan color with dark stripes.   Unlike other crickets, cave crickets are wingless, but have more powerful, long   legs that give them amazing jumping capability. They are also chirpless; a silent   terror. These crickets will eat nearly anything, which explains why   <a href=\"http://veryraw.com/history/2005/01/spiders-crickets-lions/#comment-1388\">Joy\'s   friend has seen them eating her cat\'s poop.</a> Furthermore, as   <a href=\"http://veryraw.com/history/2005/01/spiders-crickets-lions/#comment-1416\">Thomas</a>   and <a href=\"http://veryraw.com/history/2005/01/spiders-crickets-lions/#comment-1431\">Glen</a>   pointed out the are not just summer/spring creatures, they can weather the cold   too. Though, the largest amount of hits to my site in search of information   about cave crickets has come in the spring of 2005 and 2006.</p>\r\n<p>These buggers are nocturnal and aren\'t attracted to light. They use their long   antennea to feel through dark spaces and they generally live in <strong>actual   caves</strong>. Though, as you would find if you read through the comments on   my entry about these crickets, they are found nearly everywhere; basements,   crawl spaces, washing machines, condos and apartments. These are however not idea   situations for these creatures to be in.  Wikipedia points out...</p>  \r\n  <blockquote title=\"Cave cricket - From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\" cite=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_Cricket\">\r\n	<p>While they have been known to take up residence the basements of buildings, \r\n	  many cave crickets live out their entire lives deep inside actual caves. In \r\n	  those habitats they sometimes face long spans of time with insufficient access \r\n	  to nutrients. To avoid starvation, they have been known to devour their own \r\n	  extremities, even though they cannot regenerate limbs.</p>\r\n	</blockquote>\r\n<p>It is important to note that these crickets do not bite.  They aren\'t harmful to babies and they don\'t attack 	you when you come near. It sometimes seems as though the jump toward you, but they are merely trying to escape 	the fate of a million roaches. In September of 2005 Steven J. Taylor led a team from University of Illinois at 	Urbana-Champaign and reported that cave crickets left there homes at night and traveled up to 260+ feet from their	home in search of food.</p>\r\n<blockquote title=\"When cave crickets go out for dinner, they really go, researchers say\" cite=\"http://www.news.uiuc.edu/NEWS/05/0907crickets.html\">\r\n	<p>Previous research indicated that most crickets stay within 50 meters (164 \r\n	  feet) from their caves. As part of the formula for a buffer zone proposed by \r\n	  the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, a range for cricket foraging was recommended. \r\n	  The buffer zone also extends outward to control for the effects of invasive \r\n	  red imported fire ants (Solenopsis invicta Buren). The buffer-zone formula helps \r\n	  to guide where to apply treatment applications against the ants.</p>\r\n	<p>Buffer zones are designed to help maintain a healthy vegetative community, \r\n	  including woodland and grassland species, around cave entrances to protect cave \r\n	  life from disturbance, including that created by encroaching urban development.</p>\r\n	<p>On average, adult crickets were found farther from the cave entrance than \r\n	  were the nymphs. While 51 percent of all crickets were found to be within 40 \r\n	  meters (131 feet) of the cave entrance, 8 percent were found at locations 80 \r\n	  meters (262 feet) and beyond.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>This finding is important when you are considering your actions in ridding yourself of these pests. They are searching for food to bring back to their   home. Their intension is not to bother. In suburban areas, their homes have   been encroached upon and in most areas, 260 feet makes up several pieces of   property. This makes it even easier for cave crickets to end up in your basement or crawl space.</p>\r\n  \r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<h3>How can I get rid of them?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Is it a mole or a camel..........? recently mentioned in a newsletter about \r\n  pest control from as a problem on a golf course in the area as well.<br />\r\n  http://www.oznet.k-state.edu/entomology/extension/KIN/KIN_2005/kin-8/05ksnew8.htm</p>\r\n \r\n<p>I am just very anti-pesticide. Cave crickets aren&#8217;t indoor breeders though. \r\n  Spraying the area that you see them in is not very effective because they are \r\n  generally solitary and only wander into your house by accident.

It&#8217;s a good bet they are breeding in a woodpile that&#8217;s too near our house.<br />\r\nBut I don&#8217;t have another place to put the woodpile.  Some of these buggers get in the house. In particular they come inside in the fall.  I&#8217;ve applied Sevin dust around the woodpile (it&#8217;s in a shelter and does not get wet). Also, I go out at night and kill individual crickets with Raid or something similar. This keeps the population down. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>On another site I just noticed two more ideas. (1) Use glue boards inside the house in dark cave-like places. Glue boards are just cardboard with a very sticky glue. This should get rid of individual crickets that stray into the house. (2) Sprinkle Borax dust near where they are breeding. Good idea!!! This is a little known idea. Borax dust kills cockroaches and a lot of other pests. As some have said, &#8220;it cuts the bugs like glass cuts humans&#8221;. It really does. They lose fluids through the cuts and dehydrate and die. I&#8217;m going to apply Borax powder right after I finish this note. I&#8217;ve used it for other pests, and feel sort of stupid because I didn&#8217;t think of it sooner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A by-the-way&#8230; you can make ant poison (sweet eating ants only) by blending Borax powder into Karo syrup. Add Borax and stir and do this until the mixture is saturated. Borax is CHEAP&#8230; a lot cheaper than the usual pesticides.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n			<p><strong><cite>Charlie</cite> Says:</strong> comment-1357</p>\r\n			\r\n						\r\n			<p>On October 3 I posted a message concerning our camelback cricket problem.  All experts say the trick is to kill them outside the house. Apparently the ones that come inside just wander in through cracks. Kill them outside the the problem is gone.</p>\r\n<p>So we sprinkled Borax (Boric Acid) powder around our woodpile.<br />\r\nThat&#8217;s where they seem to be hatching. It&#8217;s under a shelter, dry, and near the house. Borax (sold as a roach killer) will kill most crawling insects.  I bought a large container of Borax (advertised as a roach killer) at a dollar store for $2.00 and sprinkled it generously around the woodpile in a band about 12 inches wide.  Then I sprinkled some flakes of dry oatmeal on top of the Borax to give the buggers something to eat and a reason to walk in the Borax. Contact with the Borax kills them&#8230; they do not have to eat it. There are now dead camelback crickets around the woodpile. I check every night after dark and the live cricket count is zero.  Before doing this treatment those critters were having a party out there every night.  We&#8217;ve had no camelbacks in our home for about three weeks. None!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After 15 years of putting up with these things we seem to have a solution. And it&#8217;s a cheap solution, too.</p>\r\n<p>Of course if you put the Borax in places were it will be wet from rain, this may not work at all.</p>\r\n<p>Another thing we did was to sprinkle Borax on the threshold of basement doors that we seldom open. We have been convinced this is the place they have been coming inside.  There are now dead sowbugs and other dead creepy-crawly things on the thresholds along with the corpses of a few camelback crickets.</p>\r\n<p>This turned out to be easier than we thought. We&#8217;ve used Borax (Boric Acid) to kill roaches but until recently never thought about using it to kill camelback crickets.\r\n</p>		\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Links not checked but probably worthwhile</h3>\r\nhttp://ohioline.osu.edu/hyg-fact/2000/2066.html\r\nhttp://www.puyallup.wsu.edu/plantclinic/resources/pdf/pls42crickets.pdf\r\nhttp://www.bugspray.com/articles98/camelcrickets.html - corporate sponsored\r\nhttp://extension.missouri.edu/explore/agguides/pests/g07366.htm\r\nhttp://www.mgofmc.org/crickets.html\r\nhttp://ag.arizona.edu/urbanipm/insects/cricketmanagement.html - broad ranging not specific to camel\r\nhttp://www.wvu.edu/~agexten/ipm/UPM/1/VII-19.pdf\r\nhttp://www.ipm.iastate.edu/ipm/iiin/node/95 - about pesticides in general.\r\nhttp://www.uky.edu/Ag/Entomology/entfacts/struct/ef641.htm\r\nhttp://www.uoguelph.ca/pdc/Factsheets/Insect/Crickets.html\r\nhttp://www.ces.ncsu.edu/depts/ent/notes/Urban/camelcrickets.htm\r\nhttp://www.hgic.umd.edu/_media/documents/el50.pdf\r\nhttp://www.getipm.com/thebestcontrol/bugstop/control_cricket.htm\r\n\r\n<h3>government management resources</h3>\r\nhttp://chppm-www.apgea.army.mil/ento/bulldec00.htm\r\nhttp://es.epa.gov/techinfo/facts/safe-fs.html\r\n\r\n<h3>Effects of Borax</h3>\r\nhttp://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/2002/602_squad.html\r\nhttp://sanbruno.ca.gov/city_services/our_community/householdchems/page_4.htm\r\nhttp://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/content/dpwt/SolidWaste/documents/hazardous_waste/clean_ways_poster.pdf\r\nhttp://www.answers.com/borax\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<p>the searches<br />\r\n  http://www.google.com/search?q=crickets+in+basement&amp;hl=en&amp;hs=vnD&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;start=50&amp;sa=N</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last updated March 17, 2006</p>','Spider Crickets, Camel Back Crickets, Cave Crickets',0,'',NULL,NULL,'static','closed','closed','','crickets','','','2006-06-03 15:46:54','2006-06-03 20:46:52','',0,'http://veryraw.com/crickets/',0,'','',0),

I was irritated at the insinuation that all developers were as careless as the one that he had just had the displeasure of working with.  I have a serious issue with this idea.  I would call myself a developer and I would consider myself consciensious when it comes to not only the markup I am given but, for the most part, even anal about how the markup is formatted in the source.  The implication that developers are careless is careless in itself.  Some developers surely are, but all are certainly not.</p>\r\n<p>My other issue with the assertion is that developer means programmer.  I think that the term developer is a very important term in the web industry.  For the most part, when someone says developer, they mean programmer.  I think this is dead wrong.  A programmer is someone who only programs.  At <a href=\"http://www.pixelworthy.com\">work</a>, I toil away alongside several people who are called designers, but I would consider them developers. Eric Sink explains my feelings best in his essay <em>Hazards of Hiring</em>.</p>\r\n<blockquote title=\"\" cite=\"http://software.ericsink.com/bos/Hazards_of_Hiring.html\">\r\n<p>Although the words \"developer\" and \"programmer\" are often used interchangeably, I make a distinction between them. That distinction is the difference between simply coding and being a part of product team.</p>\r\n<p>...in a small ISV, we need versatility. We often need the people on our teams to wear multiple hats, not just write code. In these cases, it is often very important to look for the best developer, and that person is not necessarily the best programmer.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Its really important to think of ourselves as more than just designers and programmers. It\'s important to be developers.  All of us should be developers and all of us should strive to work only with other developers.

What follows is a recycled email I sent to a friend who shall remain nameless.  He was working on his master degree and had built a site to assist his students.  Basic site with a calendar and some downloadable stuff for his students to help them practice.  He asked me for my opinion about his site from a standards compliance point of view.  I needed to point out to him a few things about the idea of standards compliance.</p>\r\n<p>The significance of this recycled content, my response to my unnamed friend is that there is no catch all for every situation.  Whether you are talking about standards compliance or content management solutions, there\'s an almost right and a lot of wrongs in every situation.  The key is to pick the right almost right solution.</p>\r\n<p><em>The passage has been edited a bit to make myself look like a slightly less illiterate baffoon, and to remove any mention of the aforementioned friend.</em></p>\r\n<blockquote title=\"An email sent to a friend\">\r\n<p>Standards Compliance is kind of a nebulous idea.  The term is thrown around pretty freely in the industry and has lost some of the punch it used to have.  To be standards compliant, you have to select a standard (html,xhtml,xml) and a level of that standard to follow.  If you were to use a standard such as HTML4.0 (a completely respectable standard) you could consider your site completely compliant.  You are currently using the HTML4 frameset standard (also known as a doctype) and you are using it properly.  Your site is completely standards compliant.</p>\r\n<p>A concept that has a little more weight and significance is \"adherance to best practices\".  When you adhere to best practices...</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>you are not only making sure your site is compliant with your selected standard,</li>\r\n<li>but you also make sure that your markup is semantically constructed (in otherwords you use tags for what they are meant to be used for, tables for tabular data, headings for headings, lists for lists),</li>\r\n<li>you provide meaningful and useful content in a way that is written to be consumed on the web (seperated into subheadings and lists) because information is digested differently in print and on the web.</li>\r\n<li>and you take accessibility into account.  Accessibility for not only for those of special need but also for those who use use mobile devices or those who would just prefer to print your information and read it on the hopper.</li>\r\n<li>and last but not least you seperate content(html), presentation(css), and behavior(javascript). </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>This may sound like a lot, but its all easily achievable.  The web standards movement (not to be confused with standards compliance) is about best practises through use of the 3 layers of seperation (mentioned above) and a little planning and contiousness of what you are doing. </p>\r\n<p>In the end though, it comes down to a few things...</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>amount of time you have to pour over content to make it \"compliant\"</li>\r\n<li>will best practices make your cool thing not as cool (are you stiffling creativity to achieve something that the next guy could say you didn\'t achieve because his definition of best practices is different than yours)</li>\r\n<li>and what is your definition of best practices.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Practically speaking though, this approach makes modifying your work a lot easier and takes a lot of strain off of you.  And you also have to keep in mind that my field is easily one of the most rapidly evolving you could pick.  Furthermore, this isn\'t like print or presentations or flyers.  If its not right today you can make it better tomorrow.  Bottom line, if your product achieves what you intend it to achieve then its not wrong. </p></blockquote>','Validity is in the eye of the beholder',0,'',NULL,NULL,'publish','closed','closed','','validity-is-in-the-eye-of-the-beholder','','','2006-07-19 17:40:14','2006-07-19 22:40:14','',0,'http://veryraw.com/history/2006/07/validity-is-in-the-eye-of-the-beholder/',0,'','',1),

It follows the experiences of a single soldier and the trials and tribulations which he goes through over the course of the expedition.  It was a good read.  It provided great incite to the history of the Afghan people and their customs and ways of thinking which for the most part (basing my comparison mostly on the what I learned about the Afghan people while reading <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594480001\">The Kite Runner</a></em>) has not changed much since.</p>\r\n<p>The book really tried very hard to be this great epic.  It was so close too.  I was totally rooting for it and I was totally into the book. I liked the story and I liked the characters.  When I finished though, I realized that it fell just short of my expectations.</p>\r\n<p>So there I was, left hanging, still thirsting for the epic tale that I had expected.  I needed to be quenched.  There was only one appropriate thing to do. So i decided to reread the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0786926813\">Dragonlance Chronicles</a> Trilogy.  I read them before, but I stopped after the trilogy.  There is another trilogy that follows, then the story is continued in later books.  I\'m going to read them all.  I loved the books the first time I read them and I have cruised through 100 pages in 3 train trips from home to work.</p>\r\n<p>As much as I love these though, I am apparently having an internal struggle with my inner nerd.  I find myself unconsciencely covering any parts of the book that would tell anyone I am reading a Dungeons & Dragons based novel.  As if someone would actually notice. But as Mark said, \"That\'s fair, though in truth you don\'t need to. Plus they can\'t make any of the loser jokes and you can always bust out the bestseller status on them.\"  Too true Mark and besides, if anyone actually knows what they are, there\'s a good chance they are having the same internal struggle.</p>','Struggling with my inner nerd',0,'',NULL,NULL,'publish','closed','closed','','struggling-with-my-inner-nerd','','','2006-08-16 13:05:47','2006-08-16 18:05:47','',0,'http://veryraw.com/history/2006/08/struggling-with-my-inner-nerd/',0,'','',3),

The process is simple, but the result makes it seem like alchemy.\" It\'s an amazing transformation from dirt and water to a beautiful sphere of wonder. Just take a look at the <a href=\"http://www.dorodango.com/gallery.html\">gallery</a>.  It includes several awesome transformations from around New Mexico.\r\n\r\nThis gets me thinking.

I find them far more convenient than paper dollars and just think that there is something aesthetically pleasing about the way they feel in your hand and pocket.  Dan Platt once said that the reason I like them is that it brings me back to my <acronym title=\"Dungeons and Dragons\">D&D</acronym> days, but in real life.

There has been a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/08/AR2006110801990.html\">resurgence in the popularity of one of my favorite denominations</a>.  Strip clubs and bars are embracing the bill as a way to increase tipping, but there are other areas that are picking them up as well.  The article makes a good observation however about the two dollar bill.  In the article, Peter Morici, professor at the Robert H. Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland, is quoted as saying \"In order to have a successful $2 bill, you have to have a successful $1 coin.\"  This leads back to my original love for the dollar coin.  I was rather happy to find this little bit of legislation, <a href=\"http://usmint.gov/mint_programs/$1coin/index.cfm\">The Presidential $1 Coin Act of 2005</a>.  They are going to be minting dollar coins in honor of each of the presidents.  Four new coins a year.  Looks like there will be more dollar coins soon, so more two dollar bills.
