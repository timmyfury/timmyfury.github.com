	<h3>I'm in your domains, Squatting your dudes</h3>
  <p>I'm addicted to domain names. This is one of them. I've bought a lot of domains with the intention of using them but it never happened.
    If you would like to use this domain name for something, send me an email at <a href="mailto:tim.crowe@timmyfury.com">tim.crowe@timmyfury.com</a>
    and we'll work something out.</p>
